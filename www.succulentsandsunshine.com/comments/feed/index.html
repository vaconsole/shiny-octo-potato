Water meters are meant to work with organic soil, and they don&#039;t work well in Bonsai Jack soil. It can take a bit of getting used to, for you as well as your plants, and you might find yourself watering more frequently at first. You definitely don&#039;t want to water every day, though. 

To water, we like to plug the bottom of the pot, fill it completely full with water, let it sit for a couple seconds and then let the water run out. If you&#039;re watering every other day, your plants are not establishing a good root system. Start by watering every other day then gradually reduce the watering frequency and the plant will get used to drought.]]></description>

Interesting! We&#039;re not sure what you mean by &quot;suckers&quot;, so you could have another plant that has hitchhiked in the pot with it, or a flower spike that is putting off unusual blooms. If your plant appears to be healthy, I wouldn&#039;t worry about it. You can remove the spike, or wait until the blooming has stopped.]]></description>

Some growers have reported using apple cider vinegar to treat powdery mildew, although we haven&#039;t tried it. Let us know how that works for you!

To avoid this in the future, be sure that your succulent soil is well draining, and that your growing environment isn&#039;t too humid. Allow for plenty of sun and air flow, as well. Good luck!]]></description>

It is a branching succulent, but won&#039;t branch off of a single stem. You can definitely behead it and regrow the cutting!]]></description>

That&#039;s a fun idea! :) Succulents have shallow roots, so you don&#039;t need to fill the entire pot with soil. You could put empty plastic bottles in the bottom, and then a gritty soil on top of those, so they&#039;re not so heavy. You can take inspiration for some succulent arrangements in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.succulentsandsunshine.com/fun-succulent-projects/&quot;&gt;this post.&lt;/a&gt;]]></description>
