Hopefully you'll find a few things to help you stay more organized yourself!<\/p>\n<p>The first thing I knew I wanted was a <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/29kUDEe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">potting bench<\/a>. I've been using whatever table or surface I can find for potting and I decided it was finally time to have a designated spot for all my potting supplies.<\/p>\n<p>The other great thing about a <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/29kUDEe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">potting bench<\/a> is it's a great height for standing up while planting.<\/p>\n<h4>No bending over while I'm working and no aching back when I'm done.<\/h4>\n<p>I spent a lot of time looking for a potting bench and debating which one would be best for me. Here are some of the things I was looking for:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not too expensive (less than $150)<\/li>\n<li>Fairly sturdy (it wouldn't just blow away in the wind)<\/li>\n<li>Storage area for keeping tools<\/li>\n<li>At least one shelf for other storage bins<\/li>\n<li>Lattice area for potting<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I finally found the perfect one on Amazon. You can purchase it by <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/29kUDEe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\">clicking here<\/a>. I was really happy with how durable the potting bench seemed, especially for the price.<\/p>\n<p>One downside to this bench is it wasn't weather sealed. I also wanted something a brighter color. So, as a solution to both problems, I bought some <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2cQfKlz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\">spray paint<\/a>. I decided to spray all the pieces of the potting bench before assembling it. While it probably looks a little bit better because of this, if I were to do it again I'd spray after it was put together.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-7729\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/I-love-the-color-of-this-potting-bench-And-this-post-has-some-really-great-organization-ideas.jpg\" alt=\"I love the color of this potting bench!

It took a while to get the whole thing painted and I'm just not that patient. But, fortunately I had great tips for what to do. My friend <a href=\"http:\/\/sincerelysarad.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sara<\/a> has an amazing ebook all about <a href=\"http:\/\/sincerelysarad.com\/ebook\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">painting furniture<\/a>, so I made sure to follow her directions. You can <a href=\"http:\/\/sincerelysarad.com\/ebook\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">get the ebook here<\/a> if you're interested.<\/p>\n<p>This potting bench has been so great! I love that both top pieces are removable to it's easy to access the storage area. Plus, having the lattice area is awesome for potting plants. All the excess soil falls through to a bin in the storage area below. It makes for really easy clean up!<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-7730\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Place-a-plastic-bin-below-the-grate-on-your-potting-bench-to-catch-extra-soil-that-falls-while-youre-working-with-plants.jpg\" alt=\"Place a plastic bin below the grate on your potting bench to catch extra soil that falls while you're working with plants\" width=\"585\" height=\"877\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Place-a-plastic-bin-below-the-grate-on-your-potting-bench-to-catch-extra-soil-that-falls-while-youre-working-with-plants-500x750.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Place-a-plastic-bin-below-the-grate-on-your-potting-bench-to-catch-extra-soil-that-falls-while-youre-working-with-plants-700x1050.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Place-a-plastic-bin-below-the-grate-on-your-potting-bench-to-catch-extra-soil-that-falls-while-youre-working-with-plants.jpg 735w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Another thing I love about this particular <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/29kUDEe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\">potting bench<\/a> is the plant shelf and hooks below it. Originally I thought I'd use the hooks for hanging tools, but I discovered it's a great place for my <a href=\"https:\/\/lookingsharpcactus.com\/collections\/hanging-gardens\" target=\"_blank\">hanging wine bottle planters<\/a> from <a href=\"https:\/\/lookingsharpcactus.com\" target=\"_blank\">Looking Sharp Cactus<\/a> and my <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hedgeoutdoor.com\/shop-hanging-planters\/\" target=\"_blank\">Hedge planter<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-7724\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/The-hooks-on-this-potting-bench-are-great-for-haning-planters.jpg\" alt=\"The hooks on this potting bench are great for haning planters\" width=\"585\" height=\"877\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/The-hooks-on-this-potting-bench-are-great-for-haning-planters-500x750.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/The-hooks-on-this-potting-bench-are-great-for-haning-planters-700x1050.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/The-hooks-on-this-potting-bench-are-great-for-haning-planters.jpg 735w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I also like the plant shelf for storing smaller individual pots, like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dallavita.com\/collections\/alive\/products\/small-carved-planter?aff=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">this one from Dalla Vita<\/a>. It fits perfectly on the shelf &#8212; not too heavy and the perfect size. I also have a few <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/29rabLn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">other pots<\/a> up there too. It looks decorative but it's also clean and simple.<\/p>\n<p>Once the potting bench was ready to go, I got started organizing my tools and plants.<\/p>\n<p>One of my biggest problems with organizing my potting area is keeping track of all my tools. Most of them are fairly small and I tend to leave them random places. Using the <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/29kUDEe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">potting bench<\/a> as my work space is a good start, but I knew I needed something to contain them.<\/p>\n<p>My husband found this awesome <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/29pZ5om\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">Craftsman tool bag<\/a>. We ended up getting several of them to put some of our hand tools in (like our drill and jigsaw), but I also use one now for my garden tools.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-7725\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/This-Craftsman-tool-bag-is-so-handy-I-love-keeping-my-tools-in-it-so-I-always-know-where-they-are.jpg\" alt=\"This Craftsman tool bag is so handy!

They hold about 4 gallons which makes them a perfect place to store a 3.5 gallon bag of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bonsaijack.com\/Succulent_Soil_sas.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\">Bonsai Jack soil<\/a>. It keeps the soil\u00a0dry and protected so it's always ready to use.

I've found them to be really useful and a good size.<\/p>\n<p>Now, let's talk plant organization. I have a lot of succulents. A lot. Some are perfectly planted in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.awin1.com\/cread.php?awinaffid=233213&awinmid=6220&clickref=organization_arrangements&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fpeople%2Fcameracassidy%2Ffavorites%2Fsucculent-arrangements%3Fref%3Dfavs_index_10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\">arrangements<\/a> you see here on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/blog\/\">blog<\/a>, but many are loose or in random containers, waiting for a more permanent home. I found a really great affordable solution for them! A <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/29q1M9G\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\">wire shelving rack<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-7732\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/See-how-to-organize-plants-and-tools-in-your-garden-workspace.jpg\" alt=\"See how to organize plants and tools in your garden workspace\" width=\"585\" height=\"468\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/See-how-to-organize-plants-and-tools-in-your-garden-workspace-500x400.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/See-how-to-organize-plants-and-tools-in-your-garden-workspace-700x560.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/See-how-to-organize-plants-and-tools-in-your-garden-workspace.jpg 735w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This wire rack holds a lot of plants. Plus is pretty durable and holds up well in wind, rain, snow, etc. I also like that the shelves aren't solid, so my pots with drainage holes don't have to be raised for water to flow out.<\/p>\n<p>There is a downside to the shelves being mesh though &#8212; smaller pots don't sit flat and tip easily on them. I have a lot of 2&#8243; or 2.5&#8243; plants that I've ordered from <a href=\"https:\/\/mountaincrestgardens.com\/?aff=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\">Mountain Crest Gardens<\/a> for various projects and I haven't ended up using all of them. A really great solution I discovered is to place them on plastic <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/29xyBm2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\">fast food trays<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-7727\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Using-restaurant-trays-is-a-great-way-to-make-smaller-pots-easier-to-move.jpg\" alt=\"Using restaurant trays is a great way to make smaller pots easier to move\" width=\"585\" height=\"877\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Using-restaurant-trays-is-a-great-way-to-make-smaller-pots-easier-to-move-500x750.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Using-restaurant-trays-is-a-great-way-to-make-smaller-pots-easier-to-move-700x1050.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Using-restaurant-trays-is-a-great-way-to-make-smaller-pots-easier-to-move.jpg 735w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/29xyBm2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\">plastic trays<\/a> are shallow so too much water doesn't build up. Plus, the trays give me an easy way to move plants around without having to pick up each one individually. The trays are especially handy when I move my succulents indoors for the winter because they protect my table surface from water, meaning I don't have to take all my plants to the sink when I water.<\/p>\n<h4>These trays have definitely been a great purchase!<\/h4>\n<p>Lastly, I want to show you my solution for my &#8220;garden of death&#8221; as my friend <a href=\"http:\/\/designforserenity.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Laura Eubanks<\/a> calls it (I'll tell you what is is in just a minute) and\u00a0for propagating leaves.<\/p>\n<p>The &#8220;garden of death&#8221; is a place &#8220;where succulents go to live or die, it's up to them&#8221;. Basically, it's a holding ground for succulents that have been beheaded or are otherwise struggling. No <a href=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/kill-mealybugs-on-succulents\/\">mealy bug<\/a> infected plants though.<\/p>\n<p>I use this to store leftover cuttings and base plants. Basically anything that no longer has a pot or home and just needs to grow for a while.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7728\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Create-an-area-for-succulents-that-dont-yet-have-a-permanent-home-and-for-propagating-leaves.jpg\" alt=\"Create an area for succulents that don't yet have a permanent home and for propagating leaves\" width=\"735\" height=\"1102\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Create-an-area-for-succulents-that-dont-yet-have-a-permanent-home-and-for-propagating-leaves-500x750.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Create-an-area-for-succulents-that-dont-yet-have-a-permanent-home-and-for-propagating-leaves-700x1050.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Create-an-area-for-succulents-that-dont-yet-have-a-permanent-home-and-for-propagating-leaves.jpg 735w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 735px) 100vw, 735px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I also have an area like this just for propagating leaves (at the bottom of the photo above). I haven't done very much leaf propagating lately, but I want to! So, this has been a great solution.<\/p>\n<p>For both of these areas, I used a large plastic tray that came with an order of succulents from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.awin1.com\/cread.php?awinaffid=233213&awinmid=6220&clickref=organization_succsource&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fshop%2Fthesucculentsource\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\">The Succulent Source<\/a>. I ordered about 30 of their 2.5&#8243; succulents and this tray was in the box with them. I guess I've done that at least twice since I have two \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n<p>I lined the bottom of the tray with <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/29qO19m\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\">mesh tape<\/a> since the mesh on the bottom of the tray was too wide for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bonsaijack.com\/Succulent_Soil_sas.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\">my soil<\/a>. Then I filled them mostly with soil and voila! A garden of death and propagation station. These are my two favorite additions to my garden right now. I find myself using them constantly.<\/p>\n<p>Whew! That was a lot of stuff! I can't even begin to tell you how helpful this organization process was. While I'm sure things may get out of hand again, I'm definitely happy with how things are at the moment.<\/p>\n<p>It's so much easier to work and keep things tidy now that everything has a home!
