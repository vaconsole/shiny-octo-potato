A\u00a0monocarpic succulent only flowers once and then dies. While I knew that most Agaves die after they bloom, but wasn't aware that other succulents do as well. I discovered first hand though that this was the case.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6382 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Find-out-what-a-monocarpic-succulent-is-and-why-you-need-to-know-about-them.jpg\" alt=\"Find out what a monocarpic succulent is and why you need to know about them!\" width=\"735\" height=\"1102\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Find-out-what-a-monocarpic-succulent-is-and-why-you-need-to-know-about-them-500x750.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Find-out-what-a-monocarpic-succulent-is-and-why-you-need-to-know-about-them-700x1050.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Find-out-what-a-monocarpic-succulent-is-and-why-you-need-to-know-about-them.jpg 735w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 735px) 100vw, 735px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I've begun planting quite a few <a href=\"http:\/\/www.awin1.com\/cread.php?awinaffid=233213&awinmid=6220&clickref=dormancy&platform=dl&p=%5B%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3DSempervivum%5D%5D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">Sempervivums<\/a>\u00a0in my garden lately. A few weeks ago I noticed several were beginning to bloom. I was excited to see what their flowers looked like. I'm not a huge fan of succulent blooms, but it is interesting to see how they vary. As it turns out, Semps have a fairly unique look to their flowers.<\/p>\n<p>Not long after the blooms had fully opened I noticed that the &#8220;hen&#8221; or mother plant was starting to turn black. These particular plants are in the shade so I knew it wasn't sunburn. I didn't think it was over watering as they don't get watered more than once a week and the soil is usually bone dry by the time I water again. So, I did some research.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6380\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Hens-of-Sempervivums-will-die-after-producing-several-new-chicks-and-blooming-585x390.jpg\" alt=\"Hens of Sempervivums will die after producing several new chicks and blooming\" width=\"585\" height=\"390\" \/><\/p>\n<p>When I found out Sempervivums were monocarpic it all started to make sense. Only the blooming plants were dying but the rest were in really great shape!<\/p>\n<p>Here's what I learned&#8230; Most monocarpic succulents also &#8220;pup&#8221; or put off a lot of new plants\u00a0before they bloom. This is definitely true with Sempervivums. The plants I purchased were packed full with tons of chicks. The idea is that by the time they are ready to bloom, they've already produced more than enough plants to replace themselves so they can die happy. They put all of their effort into their beautiful (and sometimes not so beautiful) flower as their last hurrah.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6381\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/The-hen-of-hens-and-chicks-succulents-will-die-after-the-produce-quite-a-few-chicks-and-bloom-585x877.jpg\" alt=\"The hen of hens and chicks succulents will die after the produce quite a few chicks and bloom\" width=\"585\" height=\"877\" \/><\/p>\n<p>While this may not be the main cause for your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/help-my-succulent-is-dying\/\" rel=\"noopener\">succulents dying<\/a>, it's definitely a possibility! I actually had one reader email me photos of their Sempervivum shortly after I found out that is what happened to mine, so I know some of you are experiencing this or will soon.

Also, if you ever see an Agave flower, you won't be surprised that they die afterward. The plume they get is huge! Often several feet tall. They remind me of Dr. Seuss Books.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"fusion-clearfix\"><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"fusion-fullwidth fullwidth-box fusion-builder-row-2 nonhundred-percent-fullwidth non-hundred-percent-height-scrolling\" style=\"background-color: rgba(255,255,255,0);background-position: center center;background-repeat: no-repeat;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;margin-bottom: 0px;margin-top: 0px;border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px;border-color:#eae9e9;border-style:solid;\" ><div class=\"fusion-builder-row fusion-row\"><div class=\"fusion-layout-column fusion_builder_column fusion-builder-column-1 fusion_builder_column_1_1 1_1 fusion-one-full fusion-column-first fusion-column-last\" style=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;\"><div class=\"fusion-column-wrapper fusion-flex-column-wrapper-legacy\" style=\"background-position:left top;background-repeat:no-repeat;-webkit-background-size:cover;-moz-background-size:cover;-o-background-size:cover;background-size:cover;padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px;\"><div class=\"fusion-text fusion-text-2\"><p><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"fusion-clearfix\"><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":10,"featured_media":27439,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[45,1],"tags":[74],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6378"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/10"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=6378"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6378\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/27439"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=6378"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=6378"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=6378"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
