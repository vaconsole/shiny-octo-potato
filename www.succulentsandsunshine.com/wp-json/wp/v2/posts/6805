A succulent arrangement can cost about the same price, even one already put together for you.<\/p>\n<p>I've told you about my friend Mimi from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.awin1.com\/cread.php?awinaffid=233213&awinmid=6220&clickref=nobouquet_dream&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fshop%2Fidreamofsucculents\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">I Dream of Succulents<\/a> before.

I know here in Utah though the selection is limited during the winter.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6824\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/The-colors-in-this-succulent-arrangement-are-gorgeous-Better-than-a-bouquet-of-flowers-585x877.jpg\" alt=\"The colors in this succulent arrangement are gorgeous! Better than a bouquet of flowers!\" width=\"585\" height=\"877\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>No Care Required<\/h3>\n<p>A bouquet will die within a few days, maybe a week if you're lucky. There's no avoiding it. But, a succulent arrangement can last months without being taken care of! It may not look it's best after a few months of complete neglect, but it will look a lot better than dead flowers.<\/p>\n<p>Even with minimal <a href=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/succulent-care\/\" rel=\"noopener\">care<\/a>, you can extend the life of the arrangement. It doesn't take much, and it will for sure last longer than your cut flowers would.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.awin1.com\/cread.php?awinaffid=233213&awinmid=6220&clickref=nobouquet_mimis&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Flisting%2F243763167%2Fsucculent-arrangement-in-emerald-green%3Fref%3Dshop_home_active_6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">This arrangement<\/a> I got from Mimi was pretty neglected after I photographed it initially. In the photo below, it has only been watered twice in two months and it's hardly seen the sun. I have been amazed at how great it looks still!<\/p>\n<p>There are some things Mimi does with her arrangements that really help keep it looking good for an extended period of time. She packs the succulents tight which somewhat stunts their growth. They don't have anywhere to spread, so they don't! She also uses a great soil that drains well, so if you do water the succulents a little more regularly the roots shouldn't rot.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6827\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Even-with-some-neglect-a-succulent-arrangement-will-look-good-for-several-weeks-or-months-585x877.jpg\" alt=\"Even with some neglect a succulent arrangement will look good for several weeks or months!\" width=\"585\" height=\"877\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The arrangement is also shipped with dry roots. When succulent roots are dry, they don't grow as quickly. So, if you don't water your new arrangement right away, it will likely maintain it's shape a little better.<\/p>\n<p>If you do decide to order from Mimi, she generally ships her arrangements within 3-5 business days, but is extremely accommodating if you have a tight deadline. Just let her know when you need it and she'll make sure you're taken care of. I really can't say enough great things about her arrangements. They were also part of what inspired this post if you couldn't tell&#8230;<\/p>\n<h3>It's ok if it dies<\/h3>\n<p>For some reason people feel like they have to keep a succulent arrangement alive and really care for it. But, you don't do that with cut flower bouquets! It's interesting that we're ok with spending $30 on a bouquet of flowers and have it die in a couple days, but if we spend the same on succulents we feel the need to keep them alive or it's &#8220;a waste of money&#8221;. This is not the case.<\/p>\n<p>It's totally fine if your arrangement dies in the end. You can always <a href=\"https:\/\/www.awin1.com\/cread.php?awinaffid=233213&awinmid=6220&clickref=nobouquet_buymore&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fpeople%2Fcameracassidy%2Ffavorites%2F10-easy-to-grow-succulents%3Fref%3Dfavs_index_9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">buy a few more<\/a> and replant the pot. Then you also get to try some new varieties. And again&#8230; they will last weeks longer than a bouquet even without properly being cared for.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6828\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Give-succulents-for-your-next-anniversary-instead-of-a-bouquet-of-flowers-that-dies-in-a-few-days-585x877.jpg\" alt=\"Give succulents for your next anniversary instead of a bouquet of flowers that dies in a few days!\" width=\"585\" height=\"877\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>You can keep it alive too<\/h3>\n<p>I know I just said it's ok if the arrangement dies, and it is. But&#8230; the great thing about succulents is they can be low maintenance and fairly easy to keep alive if you know how to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/succulent-care\/\" rel=\"noopener\">properly care<\/a> for them.<\/p>\n<p>I'm also convinced that succulents can be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/tips-for-growing-succulents-anywhere\/\" rel=\"noopener\">grown and kept alive just about anywhere<\/a>. If you really want to get the most out of your succulent arrangement, just put a little bit of effort into caring for it and it can last for years!<\/p>\n<h3>It's more unique<\/h3>\n<p>One of my favorite things about buying a succulent arrangement instead of cut flowers is that it's more unique. Don't get me wrong, roses and daisies are great, but succulents have so much more variety and diversity. Plus, the prices don't skyrocket around holidays like flowers generally do.<\/p>\n<p>You can some really fun designs that will look great anywhere, like this gorgeous star arrangement by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.awin1.com\/cread.php?awinaffid=233213&awinmid=6220&clickref=nobouquet_wonderland&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Flisting%2F173828296%2Fmedium-star-succulent-vertical-garden%3Fref%3Dshop_home_active_7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">Succulent Wonderland<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6823\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Succulent-arrangements-are-so-much-more-exciting-than-a-regular-bouquet-of-flowers-585x877.jpg\" alt=\"Succulent arrangements are so much more exciting than a regular bouquet of flowers!\" width=\"585\" height=\"877\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>You can make more from the one you buy!<\/h3>\n<p>This is one of my favorite parts \ud83d\ude42 Many succulents <a href=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/propagating-succulents\/\" rel=\"noopener\">propagate from leaves<\/a>, so simply removing a few leaves from your succulent arrangement can result in more plants! Plus, as it grows you can also take cuttings from the plants and pot them elsewhere. It's really a gift that keeps on giving if you take care of it.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6826\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/You-can-make-even-more-succulents-with-leaves-and-cuttings-from-other-succulents-585x877.jpg\" alt=\"You can make even more succulents with leaves and cuttings from other succulents\" width=\"585\" height=\"877\" \/><\/p>\n<p>So, are you convinced? There really are so many reasons why succulents make better gifts than flower bouquets. Especially since they don't cost much more (if any) than flowers and they last longer, it just makes sense.<\/p>\n<p>Now, you may be the person who'd like to receive succulents as a gift instead of flowers. If that's the case&#8230; just subtly pass this post along to your significant other.
