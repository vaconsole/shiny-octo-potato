The size and shape of your succulents will determine how to secure them during the move.<\/p>\n<h4>The two most important things to remember are:<\/h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Prevent everything from tipping over<\/li>\n<li>Keep cactus away from everything else<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Each time we move <a href=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/cold-hardy-opuntia-cactus-flower\/\">cactus<\/a> my husband kindly tells me we can't get any more and my mother says we should probably just throw them all away and not worry about moving them. But&#8230; I keep getting more and we keep moving them.<\/p>\n<p>Now that you know the most important things, lets talk about specific tips that will help you accomplish the two goals and make the move nice and smooth.<\/p>\n<h3>Don't water before moving<\/h3>\n<p>Watering succulents before moving them is a big problem. First, it makes the pots extra heavy. Second, generally succulents don't get as much airflow in a car or truck and the soil won't dry out as quickly. This can quickly cause your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/help-my-succulent-is-dying\/\">succulents to rot<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-7932\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2026\/09\/Dont-water-your-succulents-before-a-big-move-otherwise-theyll-be-very-heavy.jpg\" alt=\"Don't water your succulents before a big move otherwise they'll be very heavy!\" width=\"585\" height=\"878\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2026\/09\/Dont-water-your-succulents-before-a-big-move-otherwise-theyll-be-very-heavy-500x750.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2026\/09\/Dont-water-your-succulents-before-a-big-move-otherwise-theyll-be-very-heavy-700x1050.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2026\/09\/Dont-water-your-succulents-before-a-big-move-otherwise-theyll-be-very-heavy.jpg 735w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Hopefully you'll know you're moving a week or two in advance. Make sure you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/how-to-water-succulent-plants\/\">soak the soil<\/a> and then let it dry out completely by the time you move. In my case, I usually water 4-5 days before the move.<\/p>\n<p>This allows the soil to dry out but the succulents are hydrated enough they can last a few more days or even a week without water.<\/p>\n<h3>Contain small containers<\/h3>\n<p>This is one trick I wish I had learned a long time ago. I have a lot of small pots of succulents. I've had such a hard time transporting them in such a way that they stay upright during the whole move. It seems even a slight bump would tip everything over and soil would go everywhere.<\/p>\n<p>Here are two items that will help keep pots secure:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2d4eVZ5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\">Plastic bins<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2cigkcR\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\">Kraft paper<\/a> (or towels, rags, newspaper, etc)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I highly recommend getting\u00a0a set of plastic bins. I used these\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2d4eVZ5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\">15.5 quart bins<\/a> for my <a href=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/garden-organization-ideas\/\">garden organization project<\/a> and they were\u00a0<em>perfect<\/em> for transporting my collection of smaller pots.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-7942\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2026\/09\/Use-kraft-paper-between-succulents-to-keep-them-in-place-during-a-move.jpg\" alt=\"Use kraft paper between succulents to keep them in place during a move\" width=\"585\" height=\"780\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2026\/09\/Use-kraft-paper-between-succulents-to-keep-them-in-place-during-a-move-500x667.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2026\/09\/Use-kraft-paper-between-succulents-to-keep-them-in-place-during-a-move-700x933.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2026\/09\/Use-kraft-paper-between-succulents-to-keep-them-in-place-during-a-move.jpg 735w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I was able to fill most of the bins with a mix of larger and smaller pots so there was hardly any extra room left. The pots kept each other in place and everything fit tight enough that they didn't shift or move if we were on a bumpy road.<\/p>\n<p>However, not all of the pots fit perfectly together inside the bins. For these I used a <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2cigkcR\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\">roll of Kraft paper<\/a> (super handy by the way&#8230; I've been amazed at how often I use this) and crumpled pieces to fit in between the pots. This helped hold things in place and support smaller pots.<\/p>\n<p>The Kraft paper is great because it's strong so you don't have to use as much as you would a lighter weight paper. However, you could also use newspaper, grocery bags, towels, rags, etc. Anything you can wad up and gently stuff between your pots.<\/p>\n<p>If your succulents are short enough you can also put the lids on and stack them to save on space. Just don't leave them in there too long or you may encounter problems (more on that\u00a0on the next page).<\/p>\n<h3>Use nursery flats and trays<\/h3>\n<p>Have you ever noticed how many different types of trays nurseries use to display plants? They have a lot! Usually they get recycled or thrown out so ask if you can take a couple the next time you're there. These will make life much simpler (and cheaper) when moving your plants.<\/p>\n<p>The type at the top left is especially nice for moving multiple pots and preventing them from tipping. So, take a look under the tables the next time you're at a nursery or ask someone if you don't see any.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-7937\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2026\/09\/Save-trays-you-get-from-a-nursery-to-make-moving-plants-to-a-new-home-easier.jpg\" alt=\"Save trays you get from a nursery to make moving plants to a new home easier!\" width=\"585\" height=\"878\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2026\/09\/Save-trays-you-get-from-a-nursery-to-make-moving-plants-to-a-new-home-easier-500x750.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2026\/09\/Save-trays-you-get-from-a-nursery-to-make-moving-plants-to-a-new-home-easier-700x1050.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2026\/09\/Save-trays-you-get-from-a-nursery-to-make-moving-plants-to-a-new-home-easier.jpg 735w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Planters with handles<\/h3>\n<p>I've recently started planting some of my succulents in these <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2dbMVnO\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\">felt grow bags<\/a>. They are awesome! It makes moving succulents so easy because the bags are very sturdy and have handles.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-7939\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2026\/09\/These-felt-planting-bags-are-a-great-way-to-keep-your-garden-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"These felt planting bags are a great way to keep your garden mobile!\" width=\"585\" height=\"780\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2026\/09\/These-felt-planting-bags-are-a-great-way-to-keep-your-garden-mobile-500x667.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2026\/09\/These-felt-planting-bags-are-a-great-way-to-keep-your-garden-mobile-700x933.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2026\/09\/These-felt-planting-bags-are-a-great-way-to-keep-your-garden-mobile.jpg 735w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>They aren't the most attractive option, but if you need to move your succulents very much (whether from house to house or just to different areas of the yard) these are a really great option. This size (<a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2dbMVnO\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\">5 gallons<\/a>) is really stable so it's not very likely to tip over in the car.<\/p>\n<h3>Use a plant dolly or cart<\/h3>\n<p>Big pots can be tricky to maneuver.\u00a0I have two items that make moving large pots (or a lot of pots) <em>so<\/em> much easier:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2d2nBfq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\">A plant dolly\/trolley<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2cCOky0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\">A flat bed cart<\/a>\u00a0(and <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2dqVKJ5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\">the tub<\/a> that attaches)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I've had the <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2d2nBfq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\">plant dolly<\/a> for a while. You may have seen me mention it on my <a href=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/use-pot-feet-for-succulent-container-gardens\/\">post about pot feet<\/a>. I usually have one of my larger pots sitting on it all the time. However, while moving I\u00a0usually wheel one pot to the car or truck and then use it for a few more pots to follow.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-7944\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2026\/09\/A-plant-dolly-is-a-great-way-to-keep-your-pots-off-the-ground-and-make-them-easy-to-move.jpg\" alt=\"A plant dolly is a great way to keep your pots off the ground and make them easy to move\" width=\"585\" height=\"877\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2026\/09\/A-plant-dolly-is-a-great-way-to-keep-your-pots-off-the-ground-and-make-them-easy-to-move-500x750.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2026\/09\/A-plant-dolly-is-a-great-way-to-keep-your-pots-off-the-ground-and-make-them-easy-to-move-700x1050.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2026\/09\/A-plant-dolly-is-a-great-way-to-keep-your-pots-off-the-ground-and-make-them-easy-to-move.jpg 735w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This minimizes the heavy lifting. As long as you have a relatively smooth surface this will really make the move easier.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Mighty-Max-Cart-FB600A-Flatbed\/dp\/B00EDMCCAM\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1473998973&sr=8-1&keywords=mighty+max+cart&linkCode=sl1&tag=cassituttlpho-20&linkId=3fd6f93f84c98b23ffdcca7d3aaf32dc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\">flat bed cart<\/a> is also incredibly useful. I got this one from Bonsai Jack when he was trying out some new products for their warehouse. It can hold up to 600 pounds!<\/p>\n<p>I used the cart to transport my bins of succulents and a few medium\/large pots that didn't fit in the smaller containers. I've used it so many times over the past few months that I've had it. My two year old really\u00a0likes it as well \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-7940\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2026\/09\/This-mighty-max-cart-is-a-great-way-to-move-succulents-to-a-new-location.jpg\" alt=\"This mighty max cart is a great way to move succulents to a new location\" width=\"585\" height=\"878\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2026\/09\/This-mighty-max-cart-is-a-great-way-to-move-succulents-to-a-new-location-500x750.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2026\/09\/This-mighty-max-cart-is-a-great-way-to-move-succulents-to-a-new-location-700x1050.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2026\/09\/This-mighty-max-cart-is-a-great-way-to-move-succulents-to-a-new-location.jpg 735w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you're moving things over any sort of incline I highly recommend getting <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2dqVKJ5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\">the\u00a0tub that goes with the cart<\/a>. It will make a huge difference. Before getting the tub I had quite a few things slide off \u00a0when going down a small hill.<\/p>\n<h3>Secure containers and larger pots<\/h3>\n<p>Fortunately for my most recent move I was just going a few miles away. So, I filled the back of this Subaru Outback with all of my pots.<\/p>\n<p>The rubber mat in the back prevented the plastic bins from sliding around. They were also packed in close together so there wasn't a lot of space to move anyway.<\/p>\n<p>When I was moving them another time, I had them in the bed of a truck which was quite slippery. I used <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2crRiYP\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\">duct tape<\/a> around the bins to hold them in place.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-7945\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2026\/09\/Pack-containers-in-tightly-and-use-duct-tape-to-prevent-them-from-sliding-during-your-drive.jpg\" alt=\"Pack containers in tightly and use duct tape to prevent them from sliding during your drive\" width=\"585\" height=\"780\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2026\/09\/Pack-containers-in-tightly-and-use-duct-tape-to-prevent-them-from-sliding-during-your-drive-500x667.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2026\/09\/Pack-containers-in-tightly-and-use-duct-tape-to-prevent-them-from-sliding-during-your-drive-700x933.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2026\/09\/Pack-containers-in-tightly-and-use-duct-tape-to-prevent-them-from-sliding-during-your-drive.jpg 735w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>For larger pots you can also use <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2cGLZrz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\">straps<\/a> and cinch them down tightly. You can group a few together and put a strap around all of them, or you can strap them to part of the vehicle to keep them in place, or both.<\/p>\n<p>The key to prevent tipping is to secure the pots so they have a barrier that prevents them from falling. You could also put larger pots inside a large cardboard box just bigger than the pot. A box will generally be more stable than a pot.<\/p>\n<h3>Keep cacti (and your hands) protected<\/h3>\n<p>Remember at the beginning of the post I mentioned to make sure you keep your cacti away from everything? This can be tricky to do.<\/p>\n<p>A great option is to protect the cactus and other succulents from touching each other. You can do this several ways.<\/p>\n<p>First, you can plant all cacti together in one large pot. Then, make sure that pot is away from everything else. This may not be practical though.<\/p>\n<p>The other option I recommend is to wrap the pot with <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2cigkcR\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\">Kraft paper<\/a> (See? It's handy!), a towel that you don't mind getting spines in, newspaper, etc.<\/p>\n<p>You'll still want to keep the cacti away from other plants if possible, but this should limit the contact the spines have with anything they may touch.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-7943\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2026\/09\/Wrap-cactus-with-kraft-paper-to-prevent-spines-from-getting-in-your-fingers-and-other-succulents.jpg\" alt=\"Wrap cactus with kraft paper to prevent spines from getting in your fingers and other succulents\" width=\"585\" height=\"877\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2026\/09\/Wrap-cactus-with-kraft-paper-to-prevent-spines-from-getting-in-your-fingers-and-other-succulents-500x750.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2026\/09\/Wrap-cactus-with-kraft-paper-to-prevent-spines-from-getting-in-your-fingers-and-other-succulents-700x1050.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2026\/09\/Wrap-cactus-with-kraft-paper-to-prevent-spines-from-getting-in-your-fingers-and-other-succulents.jpg 735w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Also make sure you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/how-to-plant-a-cactus\/\">wear gloves when handling your cactus<\/a>. I know all too well how easy it is for your hands to get spines in them from just a slight touch.<\/p>\n<p>It's also a good idea to wipe off the outside rim of your pot before handling it just to make sure there aren't any spines hiding there.<\/p>\n<h3>Shorten time in covered vehicles<\/h3>\n<p>While it may be a bit difficult, avoid leaving your succulents in a dark, closed space (like a trunk or moving truck) for too long. With limited light and air flow your succulents may suffer some damage.<\/p>\n<p>This normally only happens with Aloes and Agaves, but play it safe as much as possible. The result looks like the succulent has been over watered and is starting to rot. Fortunately, the damage doesn't generally kill the plant and over time the new growth will look normal as long as you're caring for it properly.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-7946\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2026\/09\/Dont-keep-succulents-in-the-car-too-long-or-they-may-get-damaged-from-the-heat-an-lack-of-airflow.jpg\" alt=\"Don't keep succulents in the car too long or they may get damaged from the heat an lack of airflow\" width=\"585\" height=\"780\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2026\/09\/Dont-keep-succulents-in-the-car-too-long-or-they-may-get-damaged-from-the-heat-an-lack-of-airflow-500x667.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2026\/09\/Dont-keep-succulents-in-the-car-too-long-or-they-may-get-damaged-from-the-heat-an-lack-of-airflow-700x933.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2026\/09\/Dont-keep-succulents-in-the-car-too-long-or-they-may-get-damaged-from-the-heat-an-lack-of-airflow.jpg 735w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Also keep your succulents in a temperate environment as much as reasonably possible. If you're moving in the middle of the summer, avoid placing them in an area that will get extremely hot (over 90 degrees). The opposite is true for winter, keep them somewhere warmer than 40 degrees to be safe.<\/p>\n<p>Usually if you're in a car you'll be fine. It will be harder to maintain a mild temperature in a large moving truck. If you're traveling for several hours or days, just make sure to check on your succulents once in a while. Take them out of the car or truck if you will be stopped over night.<\/p>\n<h3>Pay attention to the new growing area<\/h3>\n<p>One of the most difficult post-move adjustments is finding the right location for your succulents. You need somewhere temperate for the first few days (even if your plants were full sun before). Then you can gradually ease them in to areas with more heat or sunlight.<\/p>\n<p>This has proven to be a problem for me over and over. In our most recent move I had a collection of leaves and small cuttings I was propagating (you can see them in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/real-life-succulent-garden\/\">this post<\/a>). I placed them in an area that I thought got shade most of the day.
