While succulents are pretty slow growers, they will eventually outgrow the pot they are in and even need some maintenance on a regular basis.<\/p>\n<p>Pruning and maintaining succulents is a simple task, but there are a few things that will make it a much smoother process.

In the spring, I highly recommend pruning and cleaning up.<\/p>\n<p>However, in the fall, I've found it's best to leave your arrangements as in tact as possible. You still want to clean up, remove dead leaves and debris, but generally replanting, beheadding and propagating are best done in spring.<\/p>\n<p>If you're not sure what some of that means, don't worry! I'm going to show you everything in this post.<\/p>\n<h3>Regular maintenance<\/h3>\n<p>Over time, the lower leaves of your succulent will <a href=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/help-my-succulent-is-dying\/\">dry up<\/a> and die. This is not cause for alarm, it's just part of their natural life cycle.<\/p>\n<p>However, your succulent will grow best if you remove these leaves from time to time. If they stay on the stem for too long it can make it more difficult for the soil below the plant to dry out and the plant may begin to rot.<\/p>\n<p>Use your fingers to gently pull away these dead leaves. You may even notice some new growth on the stem. If so, that's fantastic! Removing the leaves may also help encourage new growth along the stem.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-7689 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Remove-dead-leaves-from-succulents-to-promote-healthier-growth.jpg\" alt=\"Remove dead leaves from succulents to promote healthier growth\" width=\"735\" height=\"1102\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Remove-dead-leaves-from-succulents-to-promote-healthier-growth-500x750.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Remove-dead-leaves-from-succulents-to-promote-healthier-growth-700x1050.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Remove-dead-leaves-from-succulents-to-promote-healthier-growth.jpg 735w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 735px) 100vw, 735px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You will also want to remove any debris from between the plants. Especially if your plants are growing outside, you may notice leaves or sticks blow into the arrangement. Removing the debris can help prevent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/kill-mealybugs-on-succulents\/\">bugs<\/a> from infecting the plants.<\/p>\n<p>Removing dried up leave and debris is something you can do frequently, but at a minimum it should be done in both spring and fall.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"fusion-text fusion-text-2\"><h3>When to prune<\/h3>\n<p>Succulents generally do best if they are pruned at the beginning of their growing season, however, you can prune anytime. If you prune toward the end of the growing season you may not see new growth as quickly but it will happen slowly and pickup once they start actively growing again.<\/p>\n<p>While many of the commonly found succulents are summer growers, there are quite a few winter growers. Take a look at this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/succulent-dormancy-table\/\">dormancy table<\/a> to get a feel for when your succulents are actively growing.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-7696 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Over-time-succulents-begin-to-get-over-grown-learn-how-to-prune-them-with-this-post.jpg\" alt=\"Over time succulents begin to get over grown - learn how to prune them with this post!\" width=\"735\" height=\"1102\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Over-time-succulents-begin-to-get-over-grown-learn-how-to-prune-them-with-this-post-500x750.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Over-time-succulents-begin-to-get-over-grown-learn-how-to-prune-them-with-this-post-700x1050.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Over-time-succulents-begin-to-get-over-grown-learn-how-to-prune-them-with-this-post.jpg 735w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 735px) 100vw, 735px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I generally prune my succulents in the spring after they've been growing indoors for the winter. They generally get quite <a href=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/stretched-out-succulents\/\">stretched out<\/a> and don't look quite as nice as they did originally.<\/p>\n<p>Pruning them allows me to refresh the arrangement without having to buy more plants.
