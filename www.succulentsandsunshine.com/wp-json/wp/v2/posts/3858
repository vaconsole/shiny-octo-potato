It's not terribly hard, but it definitely presented some challenges. Overall I'm pleased with how the living wreath turned out and I'm excited to see how it grows. There is a little <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/eHc9Z1GWB5Y\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">video<\/a> at the end that shows start to finish what I did with the wreath.<\/p>\n<p>Here's what you'll need to make your own succulent wreath:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/1kReKj1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">15&#8243; sphagnum moss wreath form<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/1Pimx1p\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">Greening pins<\/a> (although if you buy the form above it comes with some)<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.awin1.com\/cread.php?awinaffid=233213&awinmid=6220&clickref=wreath_cuttings&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Flisting%2F226837227%2F200-beautiful-succulent-cuttings-perfect%3Fref%3Dshop_home_active_10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">200 succulent cuttings<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/1kRfBA6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">Scissors<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>With that, here is what I did!<\/p>\n<h3>Buy or Create a Spangham Moss Wreath Frame<\/h3>\n<p>After seeing what other people have done with living wreaths and succulent wreaths, I decided that rather than making my own wreath base I would just buy one. Daniel (who I bought my original\u00a0<a title=\"Succulent Cuttings for a Living Wreath\" href=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/succulent-cuttings-for-a-living-wreath\/\" rel=\"noopener\">succulent cuttings<\/a> from) recommended getting a form from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.topiaryartworks.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Topiary Artworks<\/a>. After looking around a little more, I decided they were the best option. They have great quality wreaths and their prices are terrific. I bought the 15&#8243; Living Wreath. \u00a0It is a pretty good size and with the <a title=\"Succulent Cuttings for a Living Wreath\" href=\"https:\/\/www.awin1.com\/cread.php?awinaffid=233213&awinmid=6220&clickref=wreath_cuttings&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Flisting%2F226837227%2F200-beautiful-succulent-cuttings-perfect%3Fref%3Dshop_home_active_10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">200 succulent cuttings<\/a> I got, I had plenty of plants to fill it with.<\/p>\n<h3>Soak the Moss Wreath<\/h3>\n<p>Basic instructions for making a wreath came with my purchase. The most important part of this whole process (well, at least initially) is making sure the wreath is fully soaked before you begin adding cuttings. I had thought it would be nice to work with the wreath dry, but it just falls apart. Once soaked all the way through (I soaked mine in the bathtub for about 15 minutes), the wreath is very easy to work with although it weighs a lot! I'll be glad when it drys out a little so the wreath isn't as heavy.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-3872\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/04\/Soak-your-moss-wreath-before-starting-Making-a-Living-Succulent-Wreath-Succulents-and-Sunshine-500x333.jpg\" alt=\"Soak your moss wreath before starting - Living Succulent Wreath - Succulents and Sunshine\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Plan Your Design<\/h3>\n<p>I realized after the fact that it would have been smart for me to take a picture of how I designed the wreath before creating it. Basically, I just laid out all of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.awin1.com\/cread.php?awinaffid=233213&awinmid=6220&clickref=wreath_cuttings2&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Flisting%2F226837227%2F200-beautiful-succulent-cuttings-perfect%3Fref%3Dshop_home_active_10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">cuttings<\/a> in a circle the approximate size of my wreath. This was a really great thing to do. I was able to see if the overall design is what I wanted and I got an idea of how many cuttings it would actually take to make it look right. Unless you are very confident in your design skills (and even if you are&#8230;) this is a step I would not skip. It will help your wreath look better in the end and you'll use your cuttings more efficiently.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-3871\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/04\/Making-a-Living-Succulent-Wreath-Succulents-and-Sunshine-500x750.jpg\" alt=\"Making a Living Succulent Wreath - Succulents and Sunshine\" width=\"500\" height=\"750\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/04\/Making-a-Living-Succulent-Wreath-Succulents-and-Sunshine-500x750.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/04\/Making-a-Living-Succulent-Wreath-Succulents-and-Sunshine-700x1050.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/04\/Making-a-Living-Succulent-Wreath-Succulents-and-Sunshine.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Check out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/tips-for-arranging-succulents-in-containers-and-landscapes\/\">this post<\/a> to learn about the concept of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/tips-for-arranging-succulents-in-containers-and-landscapes\/\">&#8220;thriller, filler, spiller&#8221;<\/a>. It inspired the design for this wreath. I knew I wanted to have one larger cutting near the bottom (thriller) and I purchased a large pot of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.awin1.com\/cread.php?awinaffid=233213&awinmid=6220&clickref=blog&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fshop%2FSucculentBeauties%3Fref%3Dl2-shopheader-name%26search_query%3Dstring%2Bof%2Bpearls\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">String of Pearls<\/a> variety of succulent to use to make the wreath unified and add a more flowing element (spiller).<\/p>\n<h3>Use Scissors or a Dowel to Poke Holes in the Wreath then Add the Cuttings<\/h3>\n<p>Now the fun (and hard work) begins! You'll need some sort of tool to poke holes in the wreath. I decided to use scissors since the size was about right, but you could use a pencil, a dowel, a stick, or anything else you can think of. Once you have a hole, put your cutting in it and, viola!<\/p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/eHc9Z1GWB5Y\" width=\"420\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>If you need to hang your wreath up sooner than 6 weeks after making it you'll want to purchase some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B003O8M8DW\/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B003O8M8DW&linkCode=as2&tag=cassituttlpho-20&linkId=VPJWTN5J7GTVILQ3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">greening pins<\/a>\u00a0(like giant bobby pins or the wire things that you use to hold curlers in your hair). Basically, the pin\u00a0goes over a leaf or the stem of the cutting and into the wreath to help hold it in place. Even though my wreath was laying flat (as it should be) I had some cuttings that didn't want to stay put. Some didn't have a very long stem or, in the case of the string of pearls, just wouldn't go in a hole in the wreath. So, moral of the story&#8230; buy <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B003O8M8DW\/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B003O8M8DW&linkCode=as2&tag=cassituttlpho-20&linkId=VPJWTN5J7GTVILQ3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">greening pins<\/a>!<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3873\" title=\"How to Make a Living Succulent Wreath - Succulents and Sunshine\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/04\/How-to-Make-a-Living-Succulent-Wreat-Succulents-and-Sunshine.gif\" alt=\"How to Make a Living Succulent Wreath - Succulents and Sunshine\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/04\/How-to-Make-a-Living-Succulent-Wreat-Succulents-and-Sunshine-100x100.gif 100w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/04\/How-to-Make-a-Living-Succulent-Wreat-Succulents-and-Sunshine.gif 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Keep the Succulent Wreath Flat for 6-8 Weeks<\/h3>\n<p>Like I said earlier, you'll want to leave your wreath flat for at least 6-8 weeks until the cuttings have fully rooted.
