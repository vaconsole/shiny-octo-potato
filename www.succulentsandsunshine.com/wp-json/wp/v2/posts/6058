It's something I'm very passionate about (in addition to succulents)&#8230; Photography! I've found that a lot of gardeners and succulent lovers are also photography enthusiasts. It makes sense because succulents are so photogenic. But, not all photos turn out the way you'd like.<\/p>\n<p>So, today I want to share three\u00a0tips for photographing succulents (and other flowers) and also tell you about an amazing class just about photographing flowers.<\/p>\n<p>Ready for the first tip?<\/p>\n<h3>Get in close<\/h3>\n<p>Succulents have such amazing geometric forms and sometimes just crazy textures and colors. Try getting in nice and close to capture some of those details. For this first one, I love the subtle color variations and the\u00a0pink tips on the leaves. There's so much repetition with the shapes of the leaves too. I couldn't convey that very well from a distance.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6068 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/The-coloring-on-these-succulents-is-amazing.jpg\" alt=\"The coloring on these succulents is amazing!\" width=\"735\" height=\"490\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/The-coloring-on-these-succulents-is-amazing-500x333.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/The-coloring-on-these-succulents-is-amazing-700x467.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/The-coloring-on-these-succulents-is-amazing.jpg 735w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 735px) 100vw, 735px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This next succulent plant is just crazy. Again, from far away you wouldn't be able tell what's going on. Maybe you can't up close either \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6069 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/The-texture-on-this-succulent-is-crazy-It-looks-like-it-belongs-under-the-sea.jpg\" alt=\"The texture on this succulent is crazy!

Usually I've been there in the middle of the day with full sun. While this harsh lighting is often\u00a0unavoidable, you can make it work for you.<\/p>\n<p>Try to find an angle where the light is hitting your flower from the side or behind. This will involve moving yourself and the camera since you can't move the sun.<\/p>\n<p>I didn't have the right succulent examples to show for this one, so I took a few photos in my aunt's gorgeous garden. I was shooting at 4:00 PM and afternoon light is really harsh. Here is an example of this flower with front, side and back lighting.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6063 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Try-photographing-a-flower-from-different-angles-to-find-the-best-light.jpg\" alt=\"Try photographing a flower from different angles to find the best light\" width=\"735\" height=\"368\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Try-photographing-a-flower-from-different-angles-to-find-the-best-light-500x250.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Try-photographing-a-flower-from-different-angles-to-find-the-best-light-700x350.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Try-photographing-a-flower-from-different-angles-to-find-the-best-light.jpg 735w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 735px) 100vw, 735px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>First, realize that full sun is going to give you bright photos with lots of contrast. You just need to use it to your advantage. In the first photo, the sun is hitting the flowers straight on. There isn't very much definition in the leaves and there are really hard shadows on some of them. It's not particularly interesting and seems a little blinding. Everything in this image is almost the same brightness so it's hard to focus on one thing.<\/p>\n<p>For the second photo I moved around the flower 90 degrees. Here, the sun is coming from my left rather than behind me. Moving to this other view of the flower gives the light a much softer feel and the plant is better defined.<\/p>\n<p>The flower in the third photo is back lit, so I am facing the sun. You have to be careful not to get the sun directly in your lens for this type of shot, but it often produces really pretty results. The light is soft on most of the plant but the light shining through the leaves provides nice definition. The light in the background helps the plant stand out.<\/p>\n<p>You can also try finding succulents that are naturally shaded or in softer light like this one.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6062 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Try-getting-up-close-to-succulents-to-create-an-interesting-image.jpg\" alt=\"Try getting up close to succulents to create an interesting image\" width=\"735\" height=\"1102\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Try-getting-up-close-to-succulents-to-create-an-interesting-image-500x750.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Try-getting-up-close-to-succulents-to-create-an-interesting-image-700x1050.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Try-getting-up-close-to-succulents-to-create-an-interesting-image.jpg 735w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 735px) 100vw, 735px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Try moving around the plants to see where you can get the best lighting. The beauty of digital photography is you can take photos from various angles and see what you like best!<\/p>\n<p>Use a diffusion panel<\/p>\n<p>This may seem like a complicated thing, but especially for close up succulent photography, a <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/1S8P9ld\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">diffusion panel<\/a> can be your best friend. I have this <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/1S8P9ld\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">24&#215;36&#8243; sized panel<\/a> and I love it! It folds up small so I can put it in my diaper bag (or <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/1JrYRZ5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">camera backpack<\/a>\u00a0if my cute baby\u00a0isn't with me). I can also easily hold it myself while I'm taking a picture. The great thing about flowers is they don't move much. So you can take the time to use a diffuser.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6065 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Find-out-how-to-take-better-photos-of-succulents.jpg\" alt=\"Find out how to take better photos of succulents\" width=\"735\" height=\"490\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Find-out-how-to-take-better-photos-of-succulents-500x333.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Find-out-how-to-take-better-photos-of-succulents-700x467.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Find-out-how-to-take-better-photos-of-succulents.jpg 735w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 735px) 100vw, 735px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>So, now you might be asking how and why you'd use a diffusion panel (or maybe what it is). Sometimes you can't\u00a0move to change the direction of the light\u00a0or you like a particular view of a succulent\u00a0but the lighting is too harsh.<\/p>\n<p>You can place the diffusion panel between the sun and the succulent and it diffuses or softens the light by creating a light shadow. I really love the look of bright sunlight through a diffuser.<\/p>\n<p>If you're lucky enough to have a photo assistant (or amazing sister photo assistant in my case) you can have them hold the diffusion panel for you, but if you get small one you can hold it yourself.<\/p>\n<p>Here's what it looks like in action (the\u00a0panel I'm using here is actually a <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/20oXqBz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">40&#215;60&#8243; panel<\/a> and cannot generally be held by the same person taking the photo):<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6064 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Use-a-diffusion-panel-to-soften-the-light-and-create-a-better-photograph.jpg\" alt=\"Use a diffusion panel to soften the light and create a better photograph\" width=\"735\" height=\"1102\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Use-a-diffusion-panel-to-soften-the-light-and-create-a-better-photograph-500x750.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Use-a-diffusion-panel-to-soften-the-light-and-create-a-better-photograph-700x1050.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Use-a-diffusion-panel-to-soften-the-light-and-create-a-better-photograph.jpg 735w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 735px) 100vw, 735px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>And here's what the photo I ended up with:<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6059 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/The-textures-and-colors-in-these-succulents-are-amazing.jpg\" alt=\"The textures and colors in these succulents are amazing!\" width=\"735\" height=\"1102\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/The-textures-and-colors-in-these-succulents-are-amazing-500x750.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/The-textures-and-colors-in-these-succulents-are-amazing-700x1050.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/The-textures-and-colors-in-these-succulents-are-amazing.jpg 735w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 735px) 100vw, 735px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>While this was side\/back lit, the shadows were still to harsh for my liking. Using the diffusion panel softened the light and provided a nice glow to the plants.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6066 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Learn-how-a-diffusion-panel-can-help-you-get-better-photos-of-succulents-and-flowers.jpg\" alt=\"Learn how a diffusion panel can help you get better photos of succulents and flowers!\" width=\"735\" height=\"1102\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Learn-how-a-diffusion-panel-can-help-you-get-better-photos-of-succulents-and-flowers-500x750.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Learn-how-a-diffusion-panel-can-help-you-get-better-photos-of-succulents-and-flowers-700x1050.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Learn-how-a-diffusion-panel-can-help-you-get-better-photos-of-succulents-and-flowers.jpg 735w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 735px) 100vw, 735px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>So, now you have a few things to think about the next time you're photographing succulents!
