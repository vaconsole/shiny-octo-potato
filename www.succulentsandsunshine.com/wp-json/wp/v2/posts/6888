This is completely normal! Find out what can cause such a color change.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>When you look at pictures online, you see many colorful succulents used in arrangements. Generally succulents are very colorful when\u00a0newly purchased as well. However, over time the colors often fade or change. In my experience, many end up turning\u00a0green after a few months. This is very normal and can be caused by a few different things.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"size-large wp-image-7055 alignnone\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Find-why-your-colorful-succulents-start-to-turn-green-and-how-to-prevent-it-from-happening-585x877.jpg\" alt=\"Find why your colorful succulents start to turn green and how to prevent it from happening\" width=\"585\" height=\"877\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Amount of Light<\/h3>\n<p>Just as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/stretched-out-succulents\/\" rel=\"noopener\">succulents stretch out<\/a> from not getting enough light, they may also lose their vibrant colors. Succulents such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.awin1.com\/cread.php?awinaffid=233213&awinmid=6220&clickref=colorchange_nuss&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Flisting%2F156676136%2Fsucculent-plant-sedum-nussbaumerianum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">Sedum\u00a0nussbaumerianum<\/a> need bright sunlight all day in order to maintain their bright colors.<\/p>\n<p>When grown in the shade or in areas that don't get bright light all day, such as indoors, they will slowly fade to green. It doesn't mean they aren't healthy though. They will continue to grow and reproduce, but unless they get more sunlight they will stay green.<\/p>\n<p>This is the same &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.awin1.com\/cread.php?awinaffid=233213&awinmid=6220&clickref=blog&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fshop%2FCTSairplants%3Fref%3Dl2-shopheader-name%26search_query%3Djade%2Bsucculents\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">Jade<\/a>&#8221; plant below, but one side of it gets bright sunlight all day while the other is shaded by a tree. The coloring is so different! The red tips are so much brighter and thicker on the side of the plant in full sun.<\/p>\n<p>You'll also notice more\u00a0variegation and hints of yellow in the full sun plant. The side in the shade still has hints of these colors but they are not as noticeable.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"size-large wp-image-7051 alignnone\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Being-in-the-shade-has-kept-this-Jade-a-deep-green-585x877.jpg\" alt=\"Being in the shade has kept this Jade a deep green\" width=\"585\" height=\"877\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><img class=\"size-large wp-image-7058 alignnone\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/This-Jade-plant-is-colorful-from-being-in-full-sun-all-day-585x877.jpg\" alt=\"This Jade plant is colorful from being in full sun all day\" width=\"585\" height=\"877\" \/><\/h3>\n<h3>Perfect Watering<\/h3>\n<p>Interestingly, perfectly watered succulents often revert to a green color. A little &#8220;stress&#8221; from not quite enough water can actually cause succulents to &#8220;blush&#8221; or change colors. I found this to be especially true with my &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.awin1.com\/cread.php?awinaffid=233213&awinmid=6220&clickref=blog&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Flisting%2F91678983%2Fgollum-finger-jade-crassula-argentea%3Fga_order%3Dmost_relevant%26ga_search_type%3Dall%26ga_view_type%3Dgallery%26ga_search_query%3Dgollum%2520jade%2520succulent%26ref%3Dsr_gallery_2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">Gollum Jade<\/a>&#8220;.<\/p>\n<p>When it was getting plenty of water in a cool (but not cold) environment, it stayed a deep green color.

The ideal temperature for most succulents is somewhere around 70 degrees\u00a0fahrenheit. As the temperatures drop (but stay above 40 degrees) you'll notice many colors will start to intensify.<\/p>\n<p>I visited San Diego over the winter and noticed that the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.awin1.com\/cread.php?awinaffid=233213&awinmid=6220&clickref=colorchange_fire&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Flisting%2F203012615%2Feuphorbia-tirucalli-is-a-native-of-arid%3Fga_order%3Dmost_relevant%26ga_search_type%3Dall%26ga_view_type%3Dgallery%26ga_search_query%3Deuphorbia%2520tirucalli%26ref%3Dsr_gallery_4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">Euphorbia &#8216;Sticks on Fire'<\/a> were especially orange and\u00a0vibrant and the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.awin1.com\/cread.php?awinaffid=233213&awinmid=6220&clickref=blog&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3DSenecio%2520mandraliscae\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">Senecio mandraliscae<\/a> were a very deep blue.

I'm always a little envious of the colorful succulents I see in southern California gardens!<\/p>\n<p>While I do all I can to give my succulents plenty of sunlight it seems indoors there just isn't enough to keep them bright and colorful all year. I do my best by letting the soil stay dry (sometimes out of forgetfulness) and put them out in the sun once it's warm enough to do so.<\/p>\n<p>If you have any tips for keeping succulents colorful, feel free to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/about-succulents-and-sunshine\/\">let me know<\/a>!<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"fusion-clearfix\"><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"fusion-fullwidth fullwidth-box fusion-builder-row-2 nonhundred-percent-fullwidth non-hundred-percent-height-scrolling\" style=\"background-color: rgba(255,255,255,0);background-position: center center;background-repeat: no-repeat;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;margin-bottom: 0px;margin-top: 0px;border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px;border-color:#eae9e9;border-style:solid;\" ><div class=\"fusion-builder-row fusion-row\"><div class=\"fusion-layout-column fusion_builder_column fusion-builder-column-1 fusion_builder_column_1_1 1_1 fusion-one-full fusion-column-first fusion-column-last\" style=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;\"><div class=\"fusion-column-wrapper fusion-flex-column-wrapper-legacy\" style=\"background-position:left top;background-repeat:no-repeat;-webkit-background-size:cover;-moz-background-size:cover;-o-background-size:cover;background-size:cover;padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px;\"><div class=\"fusion-text fusion-text-2\"><p><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"fusion-clearfix\"><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":7,"featured_media":8856,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1,68,45],"tags":[168,81],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6888"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/7"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=6888"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6888\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/8856"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=6888"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=6888"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=6888"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
