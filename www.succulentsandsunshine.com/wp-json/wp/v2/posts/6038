Today I want to show you the basic supplies I use when making a project with succulents. Each time I write a new post about a project I've created, I noticed some trends in the supplies I'm using. So, if you're looking to make something fun with succulents, here are a few things you may need:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/thesucculentsource.com\/collections\/succulent-cuttings?aff=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">Succulent cuttings<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/1MhZ2WA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">Sphagnum moss<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/1RHMmeM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">Floral glue<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/1IrqD6o\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">Greening pins<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/1T8lZjR\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">Floral tape<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/1cHNH5v\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">Floral wire<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Succulent cuttings<\/h3>\n<p>This may seem like an obvious supply, but it's the most important! When creating most of my projects I use succulent cuttings. For potted arrangements I find it's generally easier to work with rooted plants, but for unique planters I prefer working with <a href=\"https:\/\/thesucculentsource.com\/collections\/succulent-cuttings?aff=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\">cuttings<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>You can cut off rosettes from plants you already own or <a href=\"https:\/\/thesucculentsource.com\/collections\/succulent-cuttings?aff=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">buy cuttings online<\/a>. If I'm making a small project I'll often use cuttings from my own plants, but for larger projects like a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/how-to-make-a-living-succulent-wreath\/\" rel=\"noopener\">wreath<\/a> I will definitely order them.<\/p>\n<p>Make sure if you take your own cuttings you let the end callus over before you put it in wet soil or moss, otherwise it will likely rot.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6112\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Succulent-cuttings-make-creating-a-fun-succulent-project-much-easier-585x390.jpg\" alt=\"Succulent cuttings make creating a fun succulent project much easier\" width=\"585\" height=\"390\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Sphagnum Moss<\/h3>\n<p>Sphagnum moss is my best friend and worst enemy. It's so great to fill different containers, prevent soil from falling out of things and adding a finishing touch. It is extremely messy though. When you're working with sphagnum moss you'll almost always want to soak it in water before hand. Wet moss is much easier to work with and slightly less messy than dry moss. When it's wet it is easy to mold. When you're watering projects made with sphagnum moss you'll need to run water over the moss a couple times to get it to absorb water.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6106\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Sphagnum-moss-will-allow-you-to-plant-succulents-in-just-about-anything-585x390.jpg\" alt=\"Sphagnum moss will allow you to plant succulents in just about anything!\" width=\"585\" height=\"390\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You can add sphagnum moss to just about anything to help succulents grow better. For example, I've been cleaning out my house and ended up condensing my spices. That left me with this super cute spice rack. I knew it would be great for succulents! I simply added a little sphagnum moss to each section, added a few succulents, and voila! This arrangement should last for quite a while, maybe even several months. This could make a great centerpiece for a party or fun picnic.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6107\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/This-is-such-a-cute-way-to-reuse-an-old-spice-rack-Succulents-really-can-be-planted-in-anything-585x877.jpg\" alt=\"This is such a cute way to reuse an old spice rack! Succulents really can be planted in anything!\" width=\"585\" height=\"877\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Succulents can live for quite a while in just moss. My succulent wreath form was made completely of sphagnum moss and has lived for well over a year. If you create something smaller like this spice rack, adding some soil will help the succulents last longer. Without soil though they can still last several months if you water properly.<\/p>\n<p>Watering sphagnum moss when it is completely dry can be a bit tricky. It tends to repel water initially. To water projects with sphagnum moss, I recommend lightly watering it several times over the course of a half hour to an hour. For something like this spice rack or the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/miniature-succulent-bird-cages\/\" rel=\"noopener\">bird cages<\/a>, you may only need to pour water on two or three times to completely wet the moss. For a wreath form or topiary you'll likely need to make five or six passes with the water before it gets soaked through. For my <a href=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/how-to-make-a-living-succulent-wreath\/\" rel=\"noopener\">succulent wreath<\/a> I like to put it on the lawn when the sprinklers are running so I don't have to do the work.<\/p>\n<h3>Floral Glue<\/h3>\n<p>Floral glue is also going to be your best friend when working with succulents in unusual containers. This Oasis brand glue dries quickly and holds on to succulents extremely well. It doesn't take much to hold a succulent in\u00a0place. Whether your working on a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/how-to-make-a-living-succulent-wreath\/\" rel=\"noopener\">wreath<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/diy-driftwood-planter-succulents\/\" rel=\"noopener\">driftwood planter<\/a>, this is something you'll want to have on hand.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6105\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Oasis-floral-glue-is-a-lifesaver-for-working-on-projects-with-succulents-585x390.jpg\" alt=\"Oasis floral glue is a lifesaver for working on projects with succulents\" width=\"585\" height=\"390\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You can also use hot glue which is very inexpensive and works pretty well. While I used to use this quite a bit for my projects, I've discovered it doesn't hold quite as well as the floral glue. But if you have it on hand, go for it!<\/p>\n<h3>Greening Pins<\/h3>\n<p>If you're looking to make a project like a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/how-to-make-a-living-succulent-wreath\/\" rel=\"noopener\">succulent wreath<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/succulent-ball-topiary\/\" rel=\"noopener\">topiary<\/a>, greening pins should definitely be on your list of things to buy. These really help hold cuttings in place and often do the trick when glue won't. You can place these around the stem of your succulent or poke them right through to secure the succulent.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6110\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Find-out-how-you-can-use-greening-pins-floral-tape-and-floral-wire-to-make-an-exciting-project-with-succulents-585x390.jpg\" alt=\"Find out how you can use greening pins, floral tape and floral wire to make an exciting project with succulents\" width=\"585\" height=\"390\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Floral Tape<\/h3>\n<p>If you're looking to make your own <a href=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/succulent-boutonniere-ideas-for-your-diy-wedding\/\" rel=\"noopener\">boutonnieres<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.awin1.com\/cread.php?awinmid=6220&awinaffid=233213&clickref=projectsupplies_bouquet&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fshop%2FSucculentlyUrban%3Fsection_id%3D11586920%26ref%3Dshopsection_leftnav_1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">bouquet<\/a> or even a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/succulent-centerpieces-for-a-corporate-event\/\" rel=\"noopener\">centerpiece<\/a> with succulent cuttings, you'll definitely want to have floral tape. I have white tape pictured here, but it's most commonly found in green. You can also find it in a variety of colors online. You'll use the tape to wrap the stems of succulents and secure them to your floral wire and to each other. It's definitely a necessity for wedding florals.<\/p>\n<h3>Floral Wire<\/h3>\n<p>I'm always surprised how often floral wire comes in handy. I once used it to create my own greening pins! Most often though you'd use it to create longer stem on a succulent cutting, like in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/succulent-boutonniere-ideas-for-your-diy-wedding\/\" rel=\"noopener\">boutonniere<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.awin1.com\/cread.php?awinmid=6220&awinaffid=233213&clickref=projectsupplies_bouquet2&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fshop%2FSucculentlyUrban%3Fsection_id%3D11586920%26ref%3Dshopsection_leftnav_1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">bouquet<\/a>. The wire is pliable but also strong enough to hold cuttings in place.<\/p>\n<p>While these supplies are pretty basic, they'll make projects with succulents much easier and quicker. You'll also want to keep soil and top dressings on hand for projects that my require some deeper planting. What fun things have you found to plant succulents in? Are there any supplies you used that didn't make it on my list?
