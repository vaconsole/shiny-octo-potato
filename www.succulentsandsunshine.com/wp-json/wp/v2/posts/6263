It did amazingly well over the winter, even after being\u00a0covered with a sheet of ice at one point.<\/p>\n<p>This spring as I was cleaning\u00a0out the leaves and a few plants that didn't survive, my mom thought it would be fun to turn it into a miniature garden and I agreed!

They have a great selection of high quality plants. Plus, they also have a <a href=\"https:\/\/mountaincrestgardens.com\/miniature-fairy-garden-succulents\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">selection of plants<\/a> that are perfect for miniature succulent gardening!<\/p>\n<p>It was close to Mother's day when this miniature garden idea hit, so I thought it would be fun to add a few things to the succulent arrangement that were reminiscent of things in my mom's childhood. I did some searching on Amazon and found this adorable <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/1GrFKdp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">miniature croquet set<\/a> and knew it was perfect. My mom's family loves playing croquet and we frequently play at my grandparents house. Of course the miniature garden also needed a seating area (so someone could watch the croquet game) so I decided to go with this <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/1BNKRIv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">twig love seat<\/a>. My grandma is very talented with wood working and it reminded me of her.<\/p>\n<p>I wanted to keep the miniature succulent garden pretty simple so I decided to start with those two items and see how it looked. Here is what the planter looked like last fall:<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6264\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Add-more-interest-to-your-succulent-arrangement-by-turning-it-into-a-miniature-succulent-garden-585x877.jpg\" alt=\"Add more interest to your succulent arrangement by turning it into a miniature succulent garden!\" width=\"585\" height=\"877\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I planted the succulents spaced apart because I wanted to give them space to fill in. The rock was added to contrast with the plants and add variety to the arrangement. Adding a rock can really change the way your succulent garden looks, but I highly recommend it! At the time I wasn't using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bonsaijack.com\/bonsai_succulent_top_dressingsas.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\">top dressings<\/a> on very many projects so the soil was bare.<\/p>\n<p>To complete the fairy garden, I added the top dressing and then placed the bench and croquet set on top of the rocks. The croquet set wasn't very stable and kept falling over so I wrapped a piece of <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/1TNYJYA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">floral wire<\/a> around the bottom and stuck that down into the soil. It worked out perfectly that the top dressing made it look like a path through the succulents. So, if you're planting succulents specifically for a fairy garden, try\u00a0creating a curve that can be a path between the figures in the garden.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6268\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Youll-be-surprised-at-how-simple-it-is-to-create-a-succulent-fairy-garden-585x877.jpg\" alt=\"You'll be surprised at how simple it is to create a succulent fairy garden!\" width=\"585\" height=\"877\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Both my mom and I were really happy with how this turned out. It wasn't anything difficult or complex, but we felt like it made the arrangement a lot more fun. This pot is on their front porch so everyone who comes to the door can see it. Plus, isn't the <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/1GrFKdp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">miniature croquet set<\/a> so cute?!<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6267\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/This-miniature-croquet-set-is-so-cute-in-this-miniature-succulent-garden-585x877.jpg\" alt=\"This miniature croquet set is so cute in this miniature succulent garden!\" width=\"585\" height=\"877\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Last year we also planted a succulent garden around this fairy cottage (there are a lot of fun ones on <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/1fDfl5U\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">Amazon<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.awin1.com\/cread.php?awinaffid=233213&awinmid=6220&clickref=miniature_etsy&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fsearch%2Fhome-and-living%2Foutdoor-and-garden%2Fgarden-decoration%3Fq%3Dfairy%2Bhouse%26ref%3Drelated\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">Etsy<\/a>!) and <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/1BBQw43\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">bridge<\/a> that my parents have beneath one of their pine trees. It wasn't hard to do but really enhanced the little vignette. Again, there were only two pieces in this miniature garden (although they were a bit more than the two for the container garden), but it looks great!<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6266\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/I-love-this-succulent-fairy-garden-Its-so-easy-to-make-too-585x877.jpg\" alt=\"I love this succulent fairy garden!

It really doesn't take much (although you can get quite elaborate) and it's so much fun! Like I said earlier, I'm planning on creating another fairy garden and have been shopping for fun pieces for it.
