Then you'll be able to keep a beautiful memory of your wedding in your home for years.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6184\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/This-step-by-step-tutorial-will-help-you-save-your-succulent-bridal-bouquet-and-make-a-beautiful-container-arrangement-585x877.jpg\" alt=\"This step-by-step tutorial will help you save your succulent bridal bouquet and make a beautiful container arrangement\" width=\"585\" height=\"877\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Your Succulent Bouquet<\/h3>\n<p>Rather than making a succulent bouquet myself, I got a bouquet from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.awin1.com\/cread.php?awinaffid=233213&awinmid=6220&clickref=plantbouquet_urban&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fshop%2FSucculentlyUrban\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">Succulently Urban<\/a> on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.awin1.com\/awclick.php?awinaffid=233213&awinmid=6220&clickref=plantbouquet_etsy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">Etsy<\/a>. I was so glad I did!<\/p>\n<p>Her bouquets are absolutely beautiful and it arrived in pristine condition. The packaging was designed in such a way that the bouquet wasn't able to move and there wasn't anything that could touch or damage the succulents during shipping.<\/p>\n<p>I highly recommend buying from her if you decide to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.awin1.com\/cread.php?awinaffid=233213&awinmid=6220&clickref=plantbouquet_bouquet&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fshop%2FSucculentlyUrban\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">purchase a bouquet online<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6185\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/This-succulent-bouquet-is-amazing-585x877.jpg\" alt=\"This succulent bouquet is amazing!\" width=\"585\" height=\"877\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I also wanted to point out that this bouquet was delivered to me\u00a0on Friday but I wasn't able to photograph it until Monday. I realize that succulents can last a while without water, but I was amazed at how well the other flowers in the arrangement lasted too!<\/p>\n<h4>This really is a durable bouquet that will definitely survive a full day of use for your wedding.<\/h4>\n<p>Something fun about this particular bouquet&#8230; if you look on the right hand side of the picture below, you'll notice the bouquet actually has Aeonium blooms\u00a0in it (did you know that succulents actually flower?)!<\/p>\n<p>I thought that was a really nice touch. Plus, succulent flowers last quite a long time.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6186\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/This-succulent-bouquet-is-stunning-585x877.jpg\" alt=\"This succulent bouquet is stunning!\" width=\"585\" height=\"877\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6191\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/I-love-succulents-in-bridal-bouquets-This-one-is-so-pretty-585x877.jpg\" alt=\"I love succulents in bridal bouquets! This one is so pretty!\" width=\"585\" height=\"877\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Remove the ribbon<\/h3>\n<p>The first step is to remove the ribbon from the bouquet. You can either cut it off or untie it. I tend to save all sorts of ribbon so I untied mine. This will reveal all the stems and wires of succulents and flowers.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6198\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Remove-the-ribbon-from-your-bouquet-585x390.jpg\" alt=\"Remove the ribbon from your bouquet\" width=\"585\" height=\"390\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Cut the floral tape<\/h3>\n<p>Cut through the floral tape and remove it to expose the stems and wires.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6189\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Cut-the-floral-tape-585x390.jpg\" alt=\"Cut the floral tape\" width=\"585\" height=\"390\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Pull out non-succulents<\/h3>\n<p>With this bouquet, most of the flowers were under the first layer of floral tape.\u00a0<span style=\"line-height: 28.7999992370605px;\">Remove any flower stems that aren't succulents. You can throw these away or save them if you can find a use for them! I love the thistle in this bouquet. I think they would save and could look interesting as decoration on a shelf.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6196\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Remove-any-flowers-that-arent-succulents-from-the-bouquet-585x390.jpg\" alt=\"Remove any flowers that aren't succulents from the bouquet\" width=\"585\" height=\"390\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Pull apart succulent stems<\/h3>\n<p>Continue to cut off floral tape and separate the floral stems from the succulents wires. You should be left with a collection of succulents attached to wires.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6188\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Continue-to-disassemble-the-bouquet-and-only-keep-the-succulents-585x390.jpg\" alt=\"Continue to disassemble the bouquet and only keep the succulents\" width=\"585\" height=\"390\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6200\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Succulents-on-wire-from-a-bridal-bouquet-585x390.jpg\" alt=\"Succulents on wire from a bridal bouquet\" width=\"585\" height=\"390\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Peel back floral tape, cut and remove wires<\/h3>\n<p>I found the best way to remove the wires from the succulents was to pull back the floral tape and clip the wire near the top. Leave enough wire that you can then pull out the pieces. Do this for each of the succulents so you are left with just the succulent cuttings.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6194\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Pull-back-the-floarl-tape-585x390.jpg\" alt=\"Pull back the floarl tape\" width=\"585\" height=\"390\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6190\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Cut-the-wire-585x390.jpg\" alt=\"Cut the wire\" width=\"585\" height=\"390\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6195\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Pull-the-wires-out-of-the-succulent-585x390.jpg\" alt=\"Pull the wires out of the succulent\" width=\"585\" height=\"390\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Remove dead leaves from succulents<\/h3>\n<p>To encourage the succulents to put off roots and grow healthy and beautiful, pull off any dead leaves around the bottom of the succulent. Removing these leaves helps to prevent rot later on.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6197\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Remove-the-dead-leaves-from-your-succulent-cutting-to-encourage-new-growth-585x390.jpg\" alt=\"Remove the dead leaves from your succulent cutting to encourage new growth\" width=\"585\" height=\"390\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Leave the cuttings to dry<\/h3>\n<p>Removing the wires from the succulents can cause some slight damage to occur. It's nothing serious, but any &#8220;open wound&#8221; on a succulent can cause it to rot when watered. I recommend letting the succulents dry out for a day before you place them in soil.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6201\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/These-succulent-cuttings-were-from-a-bridal-bouquet-and-are-now-a-beautiful-container-arrangement-585x877.jpg\" alt=\"These succulent cuttings were from a bridal bouquet and are now a beautiful container arrangement\" width=\"585\" height=\"877\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6199\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Succulent-cuttings-from-a-bridal-bouquet-585x390.jpg\" alt=\"Succulent cuttings from a bridal bouquet\" width=\"585\" height=\"390\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Plant the succulents<\/h3>\n<p>Now for the\u00a0fun part!

It provided enough room for soil but is low enough that it allows the succulents to be the focus.
