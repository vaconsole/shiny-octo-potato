As a bonus, it takes a long time to break down. The Turface absorbs some of the water and slowly releases it.<\/p>\n<p>Crushed granite allows the water to flow among all the particles in the pot. Since the mix is very porous, water flows out easily. Plus there's plenty of air, which means the roots are not left sitting in soggy soil or pools water like traditional potting soil.<\/p>\n<p>The really crucial part of the recipe, though, is to make sure all the particles are roughly 1\/4&#8243; in size. It's a lot of work to screen gallons of soil to get uniform-sized particles!<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"fusion-text fusion-text-4\"><h3>Pre-mixed option<\/h3>\n<p>Mixing this soil recipe myself was time consuming and quite a challenge. But you're in luck! You can now buy a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bonsaijack.com\/Succulent_Soil_sas.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noopener\">ready-to-go bag of this soil<\/a> from Bonsai Jack.<\/p>\n<p>He's an expert when it comes to soil, and this mix in particular is amazing for succulents.

Just keep in mind the ratio of inorganic to organic material needs to stay the same.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you use another type of bark, make sure you mix in another type of rock (such as pumice) as well. The really critical piece, as I mentioned above, is to ensure that the particle size is always roughly 1\/4&#8243; or 6mm.<\/p>\n<h3>Soil for Outdoor, Potted Succulents<\/h3>\n<p>If you're growing succulents outdoors, on the other hand, the Bonsai Jack Succulent Soil may or may not be the right fit for you.<\/p>\n<p>Since most of my succulent experience has been in Utah, where the weather is generally quite dry and hot in the summers, I found that using the Bonsai Jack mix worked fairly well outdoors, but it required me to water my succulents every other day.<\/p>\n<p>I'm not great at remembering to water, so this mix required too much maintenance for me. Instead, I've been using a mix of <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2iBFaZj\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noopener\">Coconut Coir<\/a> and pumice (or Turface, or crushed granite, depending on what I have most easily available).<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>1 Part <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2iBFaZj\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noopener\">Coconut Coir<\/a><\/li>\n<li>1 Part <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bonsaijack.com\/aggregate_bonsai_pumice_quarter_inch_sas.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noopener\">Pumice<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mountaincrestgardens.com\/?aff=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noopener\">Mountain Crest Gardens<\/a> plants their succulents in <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2iBFaZj\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noopener\">coconut coir<\/a>, and have been very happy with the results. The <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2iBFaZj\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noopener\">coir<\/a> absorbs water easily, yet still drains well.

First, succulents purchased locally tend to be root bound (meaning the roots are filling up most of the pot). If you simply remove the succulent and place it in a new pot, the roots will have a hard time spreading.<\/p>\n<p>Second, <strong>most nurseries sell succulents in soil that is not designed for long-term growth.\u00a0<\/strong>Or at least not long term anywhere other than a greenhouse.<\/p>\n<p>This is because large nurseries and growers generally use the same soil for all their plants. They want a soil mix that will work for most anything. When succulents are small, they need more water, so a dense soil (like regular potting soil) works at that stage.<\/p>\n<p>But leaving succulents in this soil for too long can quickly cause a succulent to rot&#8211;or in some cases, prevent it from getting the water it needs.<\/p>\n<p>Peat moss is the primary ingredient in most potting soils. When the moss dries out completely, it tends to repel water.<\/p>\n<p>If you don't let the water soak on top of the soil and start to penetrate the peat, the succulent won't get any water. The water simply runs down the sides of the pot and out the bottom.<\/p>\n<p>So please, for the health of your succulent, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/how-to-plant-a-succulent\/\">replant them<\/a> as soon as you can after purchasing.
