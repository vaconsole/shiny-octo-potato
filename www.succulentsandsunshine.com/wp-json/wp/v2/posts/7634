It was planted in\u00a0July which is one of the hottest months of the year here in Utah.<\/p>\n<p>While these <a href=\"https:\/\/www.awin1.com\/cread.php?awinaffid=233213&awinmid=6220&clickref=birdbath2_semps&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fpeople%2Fcameracassidy%2Ffavorites%2Fcold-hardy-sempervivums%3Fref%3Dfavs_index_6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">Sempervivums<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.awin1.com\/cread.php?awinaffid=233213&awinmid=6220&clickref=birdbath2_sedums&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fpeople%2Fcameracassidy%2Ffavorites%2Fcold-hardy-sedums%3Fref%3Dfavs_index_7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">Sedums<\/a> can tolerate quite a bit of heat, they weren't acclimated to it before planting: they had been in partial sun and never got sun in the hot afternoon.<\/p>\n<p>The bird bath is in full sun almost all day long, including the afternoon when the temperature hits it's peak. Since the <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/1Qb8HUR\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">bird bath<\/a> is metal, it heats up quite a bit during the day, making things even hotter for the succulents.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_7642\" style=\"width: 595px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-7642\" class=\"wp-image-7642\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/Remove-all-dead-succulents-before-adding-new-ones.jpg\" alt=\"Remove all dead succulents before adding new ones\" width=\"585\" height=\"390\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/Remove-all-dead-succulents-before-adding-new-ones-500x333.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/Remove-all-dead-succulents-before-adding-new-ones-700x467.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/Remove-all-dead-succulents-before-adding-new-ones.jpg 735w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-7642\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">These are the only succulents that survived after the summer heat.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Another problem was lack of consistent watering. The bird bath does not have any way to get water other than rain or being watered by hand. We forgot about it and didn't water it more than once a week. In the summer, in this particular situation, that was not nearly enough.<\/p>\n<p>Within a couple weeks, most of the succulents had completely died from overheating and lack of water. I used my super <a href=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/well-draining-soil-for-succulent-container-gardens\/\">well draining soil<\/a> (which is fabulous for succulents\u00a095% of the time) but because of the heat, it only stayed wet for a few hours and\u00a0the succulents hardly had time to soak up the water before it dried out.<\/p>\n<p>As you know, in order for succulents to develop strong roots they need the soil to be soaked but then dry out within the next few days. If you didn't know that&#8230; check out my <a href=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/how-to-water-succulent-plants\/\">post about watering<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I knew that if I replanted in the spring before the weather warmed up it would make a huge difference for acclimating the succulents to their new home. They wouldn't get as hot during the day, even with the full sun, and would have a better chance of putting out strong roots.<\/p>\n<h3>How I replanted the bird bath<\/h3>\n<p>Since most of the succulents had died, I removed them, but left any that were still alive. And I had a cute little helper while I did that \ud83d\ude42 He's pretty fascinated with plants, but mostly loves dirt, so the next step was his favorite.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-7639\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/Learn-how-to-take-a-sad-looking-bird-bath-planter-and-make-it-look-great-again.jpg\" alt=\"Learn how to take a sad looking bird bath planter and make it look great again!\" width=\"585\" height=\"390\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/Learn-how-to-take-a-sad-looking-bird-bath-planter-and-make-it-look-great-again-500x333.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/Learn-how-to-take-a-sad-looking-bird-bath-planter-and-make-it-look-great-again-700x467.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/Learn-how-to-take-a-sad-looking-bird-bath-planter-and-make-it-look-great-again.jpg 735w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Once I had the dead plants removed, I took out most of the soil.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-7635\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/Well-draining-soil-may-not-be-the-best-option-when-planting-succulents-in-a-metal-bird-bath-see-why-in-this-post.jpg\" alt=\"Well draining soil may not be the best option when planting succulents in a metal bird bath - see why in this post\" width=\"585\" height=\"390\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/Well-draining-soil-may-not-be-the-best-option-when-planting-succulents-in-a-metal-bird-bath-see-why-in-this-post-500x333.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/Well-draining-soil-may-not-be-the-best-option-when-planting-succulents-in-a-metal-bird-bath-see-why-in-this-post-700x467.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/Well-draining-soil-may-not-be-the-best-option-when-planting-succulents-in-a-metal-bird-bath-see-why-in-this-post.jpg 735w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Then, I added in\u00a0soil that held water a little bit longer.
