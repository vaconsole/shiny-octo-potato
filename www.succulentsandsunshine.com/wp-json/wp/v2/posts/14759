A lot of succulent seeds look like dust or dirt so they can easily be mistaken for something else.<\/p>\n<p>My favorite source for succulent seeds is a shop on Etsy called \u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.awin1.com\/cread.php?awinmid=6220&awinaffid=233213&clickref=succulentseeds_walawalastudio&platform=dl&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fshop%2FWalawalaStudio%3Fref%3Dyr_purchases\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noopener\">Walawala Studio<\/a>. They have large variety of seeds, including some more rare species, and the quality of seeds is top notch.<\/p>\n<p>There are other sellers on <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2BssKbj\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Amazon<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.awin1.com\/cread.php?awinaffid=233213&awinmid=6220&clickref=seedspost&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Etsy<\/a> that also sell great seeds. Just make sure you look through reviews before you make a purchase. While succulent seeds are not very expensive, it will take some time to figure out if they are what they say.<\/p>\n<p>So, do your homework and buy from a good source!<\/p>\n<h3>Supplies<\/h3>\n<p>You'll need some sort of container to grow your seeds. I've used the following planters with success:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2ExP0XH\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Air-o Light<\/a> (planter with a grow light built in)<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2BwQzCu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Seed Trays<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Soil is also another crucial component. Use a soil that will work for your succulents even when they are fully grown. For my seeds and plants I use:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2CqSup4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Coconut coir<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bonsaijack.com\/category\/premixed-bonsai-soil\/succulent-soil\/?utm_source=succulentsandsunshine.com&utm_medium=referral\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Bonsai Jack Succulent Soil<\/a> (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/well-draining-soil-for-succulent-container-gardens\/\">learn more about it here<\/a>)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>How to plant succulent seeds<\/h3>\n<p>Since succulent seeds are so small, make sure you are very careful to have clean hands and a clean workspace before planting.

They also need constant access to water.<\/p>\n<p>The best way to water the seeds is flooding the container from below. The two planter options mentioned make this extremely easy. For the Air-o Light, simply pour water into the hole near the soil until full.<\/p>\n<p>For the seed trays, fill the lower white portion about half way with water. Set the black tray down in. Wait until water has absorbed into the soil. Add more water to the white container as needed.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15586\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Succulent-seeds-planted-in-a-seed-starter-tray.jpg\" alt=\"Succulent seeds planted in a seed starter tray\" width=\"735\" height=\"1103\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Succulent-seeds-planted-in-a-seed-starter-tray-53x80.jpg 53w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Succulent-seeds-planted-in-a-seed-starter-tray-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Succulent-seeds-planted-in-a-seed-starter-tray-250x375.jpg 250w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Succulent-seeds-planted-in-a-seed-starter-tray-400x600.jpg 400w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Succulent-seeds-planted-in-a-seed-starter-tray-500x750.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Succulent-seeds-planted-in-a-seed-starter-tray-585x878.jpg 585w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Succulent-seeds-planted-in-a-seed-starter-tray-600x900.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Succulent-seeds-planted-in-a-seed-starter-tray-700x1050.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Succulent-seeds-planted-in-a-seed-starter-tray.jpg 735w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 735px) 100vw, 735px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Keeping the lid on the seed trays will help slow down evaporation, but you'll still need to refill the tray frequently.<\/p>\n<p>You'll need to add water to your container daily to make sure the soil stays damp.<\/p>\n<p>Also make sure the seeds have plenty of access to light. The idea place for your seeds is next to a bright window indoors. It's important to keep the temperature consistent and not let the seeds get hotter than 80 degrees or colder than about 60 degrees.<\/p>\n<h3>Germination Time<\/h3>\n<p>Each type of succulent will take a different amount of time to germinate. Look at the information included with your seeds to determine when you can expect to see signs of growth.<\/p>\n<p>Once you do see sprouts, you'll want to make sure your seeds have plenty of air flow, but still keep the soil wet. If you had a lid on your starter tray you'll want to remove it.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_15589\" style=\"width: 1113px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-15589\" class=\"wp-image-15589 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Succulent-seeds-sprouting-through-a-white-top-dressing-in-an-Air-o-light-planter.jpg\" alt=\"Succulent seeds sprouting through a white top dressing in an Air-o light planter\" width=\"1103\" height=\"827\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Succulent-seeds-sprouting-through-a-white-top-dressing-in-an-Air-o-light-planter-80x60.jpg 80w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Succulent-seeds-sprouting-through-a-white-top-dressing-in-an-Air-o-light-planter-200x150.jpg 200w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Succulent-seeds-sprouting-through-a-white-top-dressing-in-an-Air-o-light-planter-250x187.jpg 250w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Succulent-seeds-sprouting-through-a-white-top-dressing-in-an-Air-o-light-planter-400x300.jpg 400w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Succulent-seeds-sprouting-through-a-white-top-dressing-in-an-Air-o-light-planter-500x375.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Succulent-seeds-sprouting-through-a-white-top-dressing-in-an-Air-o-light-planter-585x439.jpg 585w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Succulent-seeds-sprouting-through-a-white-top-dressing-in-an-Air-o-light-planter-600x450.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Succulent-seeds-sprouting-through-a-white-top-dressing-in-an-Air-o-light-planter-700x525.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Succulent-seeds-sprouting-through-a-white-top-dressing-in-an-Air-o-light-planter-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Succulent-seeds-sprouting-through-a-white-top-dressing-in-an-Air-o-light-planter-800x600.jpg 800w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Succulent-seeds-sprouting-through-a-white-top-dressing-in-an-Air-o-light-planter-1000x750.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Succulent-seeds-sprouting-through-a-white-top-dressing-in-an-Air-o-light-planter.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1103px) 100vw, 1103px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-15589\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sempervivum and Sedum succulent seeds after 3 weeks of water and light<\/p><\/div>\n<h3>Continuing care for succulent seeds<\/h3>\n<p>As your seedlings continue to grow, make sure they receive constant water.

I setup one tray using this <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2BujS57\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">seed starter tray<\/a> from Amazon placing a different type of seed in almost all of the sections.<\/p>\n<p>Once the seeds were in, I added water to the bottom section of the tray and placed the top on. Over the next few days little baby succulents started to appear!<\/p>\n<p>Within a few weeks, most of the seed sections had sprouted.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I was out of town for almost 3 weeks and had to leave my seeds unattended. They were indoors with very little light. When I came home, I accidentally sprayed water on the top of the seeds while watering some of my other plants.<\/p>\n<p>This really disturbed the soil and a lot of the new babies were covered.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, I left the seeds outside because we were having a warm spell (in Arizona, zone 9, the nights were only getting down to about 50). But, I also left them out when the warm spell passed and it got down to freezing a few nights.<\/p>\n<p>This stunted the growth of the seeds, but I now have them inside under grow lights where they should stay a much more consistent temperature.<\/p>\n<p>I'll add photos of this group in the future as well, though they are having a difficult time recovering.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"fusion-clearfix\"><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"fusion-fullwidth fullwidth-box fusion-builder-row-2 nonhundred-percent-fullwidth non-hundred-percent-height-scrolling\" style=\"background-color: rgba(255,255,255,0);background-position: center center;background-repeat: no-repeat;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;margin-bottom: 0px;margin-top: 0px;border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px;border-color:#eae9e9;border-style:solid;\" ><div class=\"fusion-builder-row fusion-row\"><div class=\"fusion-layout-column fusion_builder_column fusion-builder-column-1 fusion_builder_column_1_1 1_1 fusion-one-full fusion-column-first fusion-column-last\" style=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;\"><div class=\"fusion-column-wrapper fusion-flex-column-wrapper-legacy\" style=\"background-position:left top;background-repeat:no-repeat;-webkit-background-size:cover;-moz-background-size:cover;-o-background-size:cover;background-size:cover;padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px;\"><div class=\"fusion-text fusion-text-3\"><p><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"fusion-clearfix\"><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":7,"featured_media":14852,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[74],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/14759"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/7"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=14759"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/14759\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":53727,"href":"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/14759\/revisions\/53727"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/14852"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=14759"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=14759"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=14759"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
