The wreath is in a shaded area so it gets some indirect light throughout the day. It did get a little stretched out and some of the plants don't have as much color (most brightly colored succulents require a lot of light to maintain color), but it still has grown really well! So, after a year of growing, here is what the wreath looked like:<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-23555 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/This-overgrown-succulent-wreath-needs-to-be-cleaned-up.jpg\" alt=\"This overgrown succulent wreath needs to be cleaned up\" width=\"4128\" height=\"2752\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/This-overgrown-succulent-wreath-needs-to-be-cleaned-up-80x53.jpg 80w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/This-overgrown-succulent-wreath-needs-to-be-cleaned-up-200x133.jpg 200w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/This-overgrown-succulent-wreath-needs-to-be-cleaned-up-250x167.jpg 250w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/This-overgrown-succulent-wreath-needs-to-be-cleaned-up-400x267.jpg 400w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/This-overgrown-succulent-wreath-needs-to-be-cleaned-up-500x333.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/This-overgrown-succulent-wreath-needs-to-be-cleaned-up-585x390.jpg 585w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/This-overgrown-succulent-wreath-needs-to-be-cleaned-up-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/This-overgrown-succulent-wreath-needs-to-be-cleaned-up-700x467.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/This-overgrown-succulent-wreath-needs-to-be-cleaned-up-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/This-overgrown-succulent-wreath-needs-to-be-cleaned-up-800x533.jpg 800w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/This-overgrown-succulent-wreath-needs-to-be-cleaned-up-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/This-overgrown-succulent-wreath-needs-to-be-cleaned-up.jpg 4128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 4128px) 100vw, 4128px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>To water the wreath, my sister-in-law would leave the wreath on her grass for a couple days and let the sprinklers soak it. I have done the same thing with my wreath and it works really well! The wreath did accumulate some cobwebs and a little bit of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/kill-mealybugs-on-succulents\/\">mealybug damage<\/a>, but all fixable.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-23556 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Stretched-out-succulent-growth-with-a-bug-infestation.jpg\" alt=\"Stretched out succulent growth with a bug infestation\" width=\"4369\" height=\"2913\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Stretched-out-succulent-growth-with-a-bug-infestation-80x53.jpg 80w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Stretched-out-succulent-growth-with-a-bug-infestation-200x133.jpg 200w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Stretched-out-succulent-growth-with-a-bug-infestation-250x167.jpg 250w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Stretched-out-succulent-growth-with-a-bug-infestation-400x267.jpg 400w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Stretched-out-succulent-growth-with-a-bug-infestation-500x333.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Stretched-out-succulent-growth-with-a-bug-infestation-585x390.jpg 585w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Stretched-out-succulent-growth-with-a-bug-infestation-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Stretched-out-succulent-growth-with-a-bug-infestation-700x467.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Stretched-out-succulent-growth-with-a-bug-infestation-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Stretched-out-succulent-growth-with-a-bug-infestation-800x533.jpg 800w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Stretched-out-succulent-growth-with-a-bug-infestation-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Stretched-out-succulent-growth-with-a-bug-infestation.jpg 4369w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 4369px) 100vw, 4369px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>And now, for the steps for updating the wreath! Start by soaking the wreath with water. It's always easier to work with sphagnum moss when it's wet. If you spray the wreath with a hose that can help remove some of the cobwebs and bugs on the plants. To get rid of mealybugs you'll need to spray alcohol on the infected areas to kill them. I'd also recommend pouring some alcohol on the wreath form itself to kill anything that might be hiding in the roots.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-23557 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Soak-the-wreath-form-before-working-with-the-wreath.jpg\" alt=\"Soak the wreath form before working with the wreath\" width=\"4272\" height=\"2848\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Soak-the-wreath-form-before-working-with-the-wreath-80x53.jpg 80w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Soak-the-wreath-form-before-working-with-the-wreath-200x133.jpg 200w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Soak-the-wreath-form-before-working-with-the-wreath-250x167.jpg 250w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Soak-the-wreath-form-before-working-with-the-wreath-400x267.jpg 400w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Soak-the-wreath-form-before-working-with-the-wreath-500x333.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Soak-the-wreath-form-before-working-with-the-wreath-585x390.jpg 585w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Soak-the-wreath-form-before-working-with-the-wreath-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Soak-the-wreath-form-before-working-with-the-wreath-700x467.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Soak-the-wreath-form-before-working-with-the-wreath-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Soak-the-wreath-form-before-working-with-the-wreath-800x533.jpg 800w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Soak-the-wreath-form-before-working-with-the-wreath-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Soak-the-wreath-form-before-working-with-the-wreath.jpg 4272w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 4272px) 100vw, 4272px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Next, start cutting off the succulents. Leave about an inch or so of stem still in the wreath. Depending on how long it's been since you originally planted the wreath it's very likely these stems will put off new rosettes! This will help the wreath to look even more full in months to come. If possible, leave some of the lower leaves still attached to the stems. They are more likely to grow new rosettes there. You'll also want to leave a relatively long stem on the cutting. This will make it easier to re-insert the cutting into the wreath later on.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-23558 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Clip-off-succulents-and-leave-about-one-inch-of-stem.jpg\" alt=\"Clip off succulents and leave about one inch of stem\" width=\"4742\" height=\"3161\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Clip-off-succulents-and-leave-about-one-inch-of-stem-80x53.jpg 80w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Clip-off-succulents-and-leave-about-one-inch-of-stem-200x133.jpg 200w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Clip-off-succulents-and-leave-about-one-inch-of-stem-250x167.jpg 250w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Clip-off-succulents-and-leave-about-one-inch-of-stem-400x267.jpg 400w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Clip-off-succulents-and-leave-about-one-inch-of-stem-500x333.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Clip-off-succulents-and-leave-about-one-inch-of-stem-585x390.jpg 585w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Clip-off-succulents-and-leave-about-one-inch-of-stem-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Clip-off-succulents-and-leave-about-one-inch-of-stem-700x467.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Clip-off-succulents-and-leave-about-one-inch-of-stem-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Clip-off-succulents-and-leave-about-one-inch-of-stem-800x533.jpg 800w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Clip-off-succulents-and-leave-about-one-inch-of-stem-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Clip-off-succulents-and-leave-about-one-inch-of-stem.jpg 4742w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 4742px) 100vw, 4742px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If some of the plants are still low and close to the wreath you can leave them there rather than cutting them off.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-23560 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Place-succulent-cuttings-back-in-the-wreath-form.jpg\" alt=\"Place succulent cuttings back in the wreath form\" width=\"5180\" height=\"3453\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Place-succulent-cuttings-back-in-the-wreath-form-80x53.jpg 80w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Place-succulent-cuttings-back-in-the-wreath-form-200x133.jpg 200w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Place-succulent-cuttings-back-in-the-wreath-form-250x167.jpg 250w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Place-succulent-cuttings-back-in-the-wreath-form-400x267.jpg 400w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Place-succulent-cuttings-back-in-the-wreath-form-500x333.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Place-succulent-cuttings-back-in-the-wreath-form-585x390.jpg 585w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Place-succulent-cuttings-back-in-the-wreath-form-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Place-succulent-cuttings-back-in-the-wreath-form-700x467.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Place-succulent-cuttings-back-in-the-wreath-form-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Place-succulent-cuttings-back-in-the-wreath-form-800x533.jpg 800w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Place-succulent-cuttings-back-in-the-wreath-form-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Place-succulent-cuttings-back-in-the-wreath-form.jpg 5180w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 5180px) 100vw, 5180px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Wait a day or two for the cuttings to dry.

The stems with leaves on them still also blend in really well and continue to give the wreath color and texture.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-23561 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Detail-shot-of-succulent-wreath-with-stems-showing.jpg\" alt=\"Detail shot of succulent wreath with stems showing\" width=\"4212\" height=\"2808\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Detail-shot-of-succulent-wreath-with-stems-showing-80x53.jpg 80w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Detail-shot-of-succulent-wreath-with-stems-showing-200x133.jpg 200w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Detail-shot-of-succulent-wreath-with-stems-showing-250x167.jpg 250w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Detail-shot-of-succulent-wreath-with-stems-showing-400x267.jpg 400w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Detail-shot-of-succulent-wreath-with-stems-showing-500x333.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Detail-shot-of-succulent-wreath-with-stems-showing-585x390.jpg 585w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Detail-shot-of-succulent-wreath-with-stems-showing-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Detail-shot-of-succulent-wreath-with-stems-showing-700x467.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Detail-shot-of-succulent-wreath-with-stems-showing-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Detail-shot-of-succulent-wreath-with-stems-showing-800x533.jpg 800w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Detail-shot-of-succulent-wreath-with-stems-showing-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Detail-shot-of-succulent-wreath-with-stems-showing.jpg 4212w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 4212px) 100vw, 4212px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-23562 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Leave-the-leaves-on-stems-if-possible-to-promote-new-growth.jpg\" alt=\"Leave the leaves on stems if possible to promote new growth\" width=\"4027\" height=\"2685\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Leave-the-leaves-on-stems-if-possible-to-promote-new-growth-80x53.jpg 80w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Leave-the-leaves-on-stems-if-possible-to-promote-new-growth-200x133.jpg 200w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Leave-the-leaves-on-stems-if-possible-to-promote-new-growth-250x167.jpg 250w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Leave-the-leaves-on-stems-if-possible-to-promote-new-growth-400x267.jpg 400w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Leave-the-leaves-on-stems-if-possible-to-promote-new-growth-500x333.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Leave-the-leaves-on-stems-if-possible-to-promote-new-growth-585x390.jpg 585w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Leave-the-leaves-on-stems-if-possible-to-promote-new-growth-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Leave-the-leaves-on-stems-if-possible-to-promote-new-growth-700x467.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Leave-the-leaves-on-stems-if-possible-to-promote-new-growth-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Leave-the-leaves-on-stems-if-possible-to-promote-new-growth-800x533.jpg 800w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Leave-the-leaves-on-stems-if-possible-to-promote-new-growth-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Leave-the-leaves-on-stems-if-possible-to-promote-new-growth.jpg 4027w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 4027px) 100vw, 4027px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The awesome thing about being able to maintain a succulent wreath like this is that each year the wreath will get more and more full!

If they aren't frost tolerant (and you experience extended periods of freezing temperatures) you'll want to bring the wreath somewhere warmer.<\/p>\n<p>Assuming it needs to be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/caring-for-succulents-in-winter\/\">taken out of the cold<\/a>, you'll want to make sure your wreath is in a room that has plenty of sunlight.

When you do water, you can lay the wreath in a tub of water, and let it soak for about 5 minutes. Then let it drain, and you can hang it again!<\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<\/div><div class=\"fusion-text fusion-text-3\"><h3>How to Care for a Succulent Wreath<\/h3>\n<p>I've said this before, but your environment makes a huge difference in how you take care of succulents but hopefully this will provide a good guide for you that you can adapt to wherever you live!<\/p>\n<h3>Watering<\/h3>\n<p>The beautiful thing about the succulent wreaths I've made is the base of the wreath is <a href=\"http:\/\/topiaryartworks.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sphagnum moss<\/a>. The moss naturally has air pockets in it so even though the moss is soaking wet, the stems of the succulents don\u2019t rot from all the water. They have plenty of room to breathe.<\/p>\n<p>So, to water the wreath you simply soak the whole wreath in water for a few minutes. For the <a title=\"Living Wreath Made with Succulents\" href=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/living-wreath-made-with-succulents\/\" rel=\"noopener\">13\u201d wreath<\/a> I made this took about 5 minutes.

Basically you\u2019ll water the wreath once the sphagnum dries out. My wreath is on my front door which faces north. It gets some sun in the afternoon and the door gets pretty hot. The wreath tends to dry out about every 5 days, sometimes less depending on the weather, so I've been watering 1-2 times a week.<\/p>\n<p>If you live in a dry climate, be careful to give your plants enough water without drowning them. If you are in a more humid or cooler climate you will likely be able to water less, say every other week. Just keep an eye on it and water when it\u2019s dry.<\/p>\n<h3>Sunlight<\/h3>\n<p>As with all succulents, you want to make sure your wreath gets enough light that the plants don\u2019t stretch. Stretching succulents will make the wreath look overgrown really quickly. On the other hand, you don\u2019t want to put them in direct sunlight, especially in the afternoon when it\u2019s the hottest outside.<\/p>\n<p>While some fully rooted succulents can tolerate full sun, strong direct sunlight is the quickest way to destroy your wreath.

If your door faces south you may want to consider hanging the wreath elsewhere as south facing sun in the summer is pretty brutal. So far I haven\u2019t noticed any stretching on my wreath which, again, is on my north facing door.<\/p>\n<h3>Longevity<\/h3>\n<p>A succulent wreath will definitely last for a full summer and shouldn't require too much trimming. You can keep your wreath for years to come but you will have to cut back the plants to keep it nicely trimmed.<\/p>\n<p>The tight composition of the wreath will eventually become overgrown, but if you chop off the heads new ones will grow! Plus, you could use the cuttings to create another wreath :). This is the first summer I've had my wreath, but I\u2019m confident I\u2019ll keep it for much longer.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-23570 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Learn-the-steps-for-caring-for-a-succulent-wreath-in-this-post.jpg\" alt=\"Learn the steps for caring for a succulent wreath in this post\" width=\"5472\" height=\"3648\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Learn-the-steps-for-caring-for-a-succulent-wreath-in-this-post-80x53.jpg 80w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Learn-the-steps-for-caring-for-a-succulent-wreath-in-this-post-200x133.jpg 200w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Learn-the-steps-for-caring-for-a-succulent-wreath-in-this-post-250x167.jpg 250w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Learn-the-steps-for-caring-for-a-succulent-wreath-in-this-post-400x267.jpg 400w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Learn-the-steps-for-caring-for-a-succulent-wreath-in-this-post-500x333.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Learn-the-steps-for-caring-for-a-succulent-wreath-in-this-post-585x390.jpg 585w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Learn-the-steps-for-caring-for-a-succulent-wreath-in-this-post-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Learn-the-steps-for-caring-for-a-succulent-wreath-in-this-post-700x467.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Learn-the-steps-for-caring-for-a-succulent-wreath-in-this-post-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Learn-the-steps-for-caring-for-a-succulent-wreath-in-this-post-800x533.jpg 800w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Learn-the-steps-for-caring-for-a-succulent-wreath-in-this-post-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Learn-the-steps-for-caring-for-a-succulent-wreath-in-this-post.jpg 5472w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 5472px) 100vw, 5472px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Winter<\/h3>\n<p>If you are like me and your winter climate gets to freezing temperatures and below, you\u2019ll need to bring your wreath in during the winter (check out what <a title=\"Frost damage on non cold hardy plants\" href=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/frost-damage-on-non-cold-hardy-plants\/\" rel=\"noopener\">frost damaged succulents<\/a> look like).

Then let it drain, and you can hang it again!<\/p>\n<h3><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-23571 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Learn-how-to-care-for-your-living-succulent-wreath.jpg\" alt=\"Learn how to care for your living succulent wreath\" width=\"3249\" height=\"4873\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Learn-how-to-care-for-your-living-succulent-wreath-53x80.jpg 53w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Learn-how-to-care-for-your-living-succulent-wreath-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Learn-how-to-care-for-your-living-succulent-wreath-250x375.jpg 250w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Learn-how-to-care-for-your-living-succulent-wreath-400x600.jpg 400w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Learn-how-to-care-for-your-living-succulent-wreath-500x750.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Learn-how-to-care-for-your-living-succulent-wreath-585x877.jpg 585w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Learn-how-to-care-for-your-living-succulent-wreath-600x900.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Learn-how-to-care-for-your-living-succulent-wreath-700x1050.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Learn-how-to-care-for-your-living-succulent-wreath-768x1152.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Learn-how-to-care-for-your-living-succulent-wreath-800x1200.jpg 800w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Learn-how-to-care-for-your-living-succulent-wreath-1200x1800.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Learn-how-to-care-for-your-living-succulent-wreath.jpg 3249w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3249px) 100vw, 3249px\" \/><\/h3>\n<p>Do you have a succulent wreath?
