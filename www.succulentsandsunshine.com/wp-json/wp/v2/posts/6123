For a long time I didn't really understand what they were or why they were different or interesting. Now that I've seen more and asked some questions I find them quite fascinating!<\/p>\n<p>Cresting is a mutation that occurs as the plant grows. Instead of producing more branches or stems, the plant flattens out and creates a wide flat surface. The leaves generally grow along the top of ridge of this wide growth and they are very compact. It's something that happens naturally and can't be forced so they are more rare than their non-crested counterparts.<\/p>\n<p>I saw my first crested succulent (at least that I'm aware of) in person in the garden of Mimi from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.awin1.com\/cread.php?awinaffid=233213&awinmid=6220&clickref=crested_mimi&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fshop%2FiDreamOfSucculents\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">I Dream of Succulents<\/a>.

That was the first crested succulent I owned. I still have it, although it is slightly sunburned so I'll have to show it off when it's looking a little happier. I saw a crested &#8216;Topsy Turvy' in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.awin1.com\/cread.php?awinaffid=233213&awinmid=6220&clickref=crested_rancho&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fshop%2FRanchoGarciaNursery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">Rancho Garcia Nursery's<\/a> shop on Etsy and knew I needed to add that to my collection.

They had an amazing collection of crested Aeoniums.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6124\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/A-gorgeous-crested-Aeonium-at-Seaside-Gardens-585x390.jpg\" alt=\"A gorgeous crested Aeonium at Seaside Gardens\" width=\"585\" height=\"390\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6128\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/These-two-crested-Aeoniums-are-incredible-585x390.jpg\" alt=\"These two crested Aeoniums are incredible!\" width=\"585\" height=\"390\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I love how this one also had a bunch of normal stems coming off it too.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6125\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Crested-succulents-are-so-amazing-I-love-all-the-variety-on-this-one-585x390.jpg\" alt=\"Crested succulents are so amazing! I love all the variety on this one!\" width=\"585\" height=\"390\" \/><\/p>\n<p>While I was looking over some cold hardy succulents I had planted at my parents house, I came across this little crested Sedum Angelina. I was so excited to have a succulent that crested on it's own in a garden under my care. It was so small that I decided to pull it out and plant it in a container so I can nurture it. Hopefully it does a little better that way.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6129\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/This-baby-crested-Sedum-is-so-cute-585x877.jpg\" alt=\"This baby crested Sedum is so cute!\" width=\"585\" height=\"877\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Aren't crested succulents amazing? It's fun to have something rare in your collection but often rare plants are too expensive to justify owning. Crested succulents, while somewhat rare, aren't too pricey so they are the perfect addition to your succulent collection! So head over to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.awin1.com\/cread.php?awinaffid=233213&awinmid=6220&clickref=crested_CTS2&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fshop%2FCTSairplants%2Fsearch%3Fsearch_query%3Dcrested%26order%3Ddate_desc%26view_type%3Dgallery%26ref%3Dshop_search\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">CTS Airplants<\/a>\u00a0and pick out your favorite!<\/p>\n<p>That brings me to today's succulent product. I'm a sucker for pottery. I can buy pottery as fast or faster than succulents. One of my all time favorite ceramic artists is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.awin1.com\/cread.php?awinaffid=233213&awinmid=6220&clickref=crested_susan&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fshop%2FSusansCeramics%3Fref%3Dpr_faveshops%23\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">Susan Aach<\/a>. Her work is beautiful! I had the opportunity to meet her when I was in California working on a project. Cindy of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/TheSucculentPerch\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Succulent Perch<\/a> introduced me to her gorgeous work. The arrangement below was created by Cindy (who is a master of pairing succulents with Susan's pottery).<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6127\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Stunning-pottery-by-Susan-Aach-and-succulents-arranged-by-The-Succulent-Perch-585x877.jpg\" alt=\"Stunning pottery by Susan Aach and succulents arranged by The Succulent Perch\" width=\"585\" height=\"877\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I love the texture and details in her work. I was also fortunate enough to have her tell me a little more about how she creates these pieces of art. They are designed to mimic things found in nature. Her pieces are meant to be felt and from looking at them you definitely want to. Her style is very different from everything I've seen. It's very earthy and organic and each one would be perfect filled with succulents!<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6131\" src=\"https:\/\/www.succulentsandsunshine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Gorgeous-pottery-by-Susan-Aach-and-succulent-arrangement-by-The-Succulent-Perch-585x877.jpg\" alt=\"Gorgeous pottery by Susan Aach and succulent arrangement by The Succulent Perch\" width=\"585\" height=\"877\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Be sure to stop by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.awin1.com\/cread.php?awinaffid=233213&awinmid=6220&clickref=crested_susan2&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fshop%2FSusansCeramics%3Fref%3Dpr_faveshops%23\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">Susan's shop<\/a> to see more of her amazing work.
